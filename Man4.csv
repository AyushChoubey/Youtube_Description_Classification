17,Q4AuIFqneUU,Royal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - Chennai,"Royal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant Chennai / Full bullet making process /RE Plant Channai

Royal Enfield has begun commercial production at its new manufacturing facility at Vallam Vadagal near Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Spread over 50 acres, the plant is the bike maker's third manufacturing facility and will manufacture Royal Enfield motorcycles for India and international markets.

Construction of the new facility started 15 months back and has been completed in record time. The new facility has been benchmarked to the highest level of quality and productivity. The manufacturing capacity in this facility will enable the company to meet its next level of growth.

In the first phase, the state-of-the-art plant kicks off with an installed production capacity of 300,000 motorcycles. In FY2017-18, the combined production capacity from all the three plants is planned to be 8,25,000 units. In FY2016-17, Royal Enfield produced and sold 6,67,135 motorcycles, nearing its installed capacity. The company‚Äôs sales have grown at a compounded rate of over 55 percent over the past six years. According to Royal Enfield, its order book continues to be strong and there is a large unmet demand. In FY2017-18, it plans to invest Rs 800 crore, largely towards capacity expansion at Vallam Vadagal, new products and platforms, and setting up of technical centres in Leicester, UK and Chennai, India. This investment will be funded through internal accruals.

Recently, Bajaj Auto formed an alliance with Triumph Motorcycles to enter the mid-sized motorcycle space. There are a number of other domestic OEMs also eyeing this segment. The capacity expansion is also part of Royal Enfield‚Äôs strategy to prepare itself to face competition.

As an absolute first in its class, the 390 DUKE boasts a glorious TFT display. This multicolor combination of relevant information presents all relevant data in a clear-cut, uncluttered way. As you rev the engine, the display bars change color, either spurring you on or telling you to back off when the engine‚Äôs still cold. The display also automatically adapts its illumination to the ambient ligh. Form and function are integrated beautifully in the 390 DUKE. Take the LED headlight for example, a highlight in this bike‚Äôs design and a clear referral to the 1290 SUPER DUKE R. It combines optimal illumination of the near field with maximum light output. And the parking light, which consists of 20 LEDs, ensures that the motorcycle is perceived better and is more differentiated by other traffic users, thus offering massive safety benefits.

Grab yourself a brew, sit back and watch this enchanting video of a Rover motorcycle being constructed back in the good old days of hand crafted machinery.  From casting the cylinders to machining the crank and assembling the engine, this a wonderful insight into the vintage days of building motorcycles for the road.  And keep your eye out for the test rider who hits the water feature with a little bit too much gusto!

The Rover company began to develop and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and 'springer' front forks, an improvement ahead of its time. The first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, a bottom-bracket engine, and mechanically operated valves. Featuring a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904.

38,Acnl6KYRS,2018 new TVS Apache RR310 (India) factory production promo video,"2018 new TVS Apache RR310 (India) factory production promo video
TVS Apache RR 310 by TVS Motor launch
Unveiling the new TVS Apache RR 310 at the launch, Mr. Sudarshan Venu, Joint Managing Director, TVS Motor Company said, ‚ÄúThe launch of TVS Apache RR 310 marks a major milestone, as it ushers in a new era at TVS Motor Company. Our endeavour is to fulfill the aspirations of discerning customers by offering high-quality, technologically-innovative products. The TVS Apache RR 310 is the most advanced and exclusive offering in our product portfolio, as it is a manifestation of 35 years of learnings from the race track, coupled with cutting-edge technology. We are confident that customers will find it to be a perfect combination of racecraft technology and riding dynamics.‚Äù
Speaking at the launch, Mr. KN Radhakrishnan, President & Chief Executive Officer, TVS Motor Company, said, ‚ÄúToday is a proud moment for us at TVS Motor Company. Driven by our promise of delivering more to customers than their expectations, TVS Apache RR 310 is the beginning of our breakthrough into the super-premium category. We started building our premium brand - Apache RTR with 150cc and succeeded in raising the customer aspirations with 180cc and 200cc bikes. TVS Apache RR 310 is another step in our effort to deliver beyond customers‚Äô expectations and offering them a chance to upgrade from premium to super-premium category.‚Äù 
The TVS Apache RR 310 gets a 312cc, single-cylinder, 4-stroke, 4-valve, liquid-cooled engine that churns out 34 PS@9700 rpm and 27.3 NM@7700 rpm. The engine is mated to a 6-speed super-slick gear box that offers a precise and sharp race-shift experience. The motorcycle boasts of a top speed of 160 kmph, and acceleration from 0-to-60 kmph in just 2.9 seconds, thanks to an advanced aerodynamics package that promises the lowest coefficient of drag in this segment.
Staying true to 35 years of TVS Racing pedigree, TVS Apache RR 310 comes with an all-new, race origin, light-weight trellis-frame chassis for enhanced stiffness in straights, and flex for dynamic cornering capability, that result in best-in-class riding dynamics. The motorcycle uses a unique reverse inclined DOHC (double overhead cam) engine with LCOC (liquid-cooled oil coolant) technology. This facilitates a compact layout for an ideal power-to-weight ratio and better mass centralization.
The TVS Apache RR 310 is equipped with a race-inspired vertical speedo-cum-tachometer with 18 racing tell-tale diagnostics, and a comprehensive post-ride analysis. The motorcycle is fitted with first-in-class bi-LED twin projector head lamps for maximum reach and visibility. It is also outfitted with Michelin Street Sport tyres, and is the first sub-500cc motorcycle to use these.
TVS Apache RR 310 sports a fully-faired, sporty design with superior ergonomics to ensure maximum ride comfort. The Thermal Management System on the motorcycle is fitted with a special gill profile to shield the rider‚Äôs leg from engine heat, and aids better heat dissipation. To accentuate the handling and ride experience, the TVS Apache RR 310 gets the Race Spec KYB Suspension that is tested and tuned by MotoGP experts. Both, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) and Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system, will be available as standard on the TVS Apache RR 310. The motorcycle comes in 2 impressive colours ‚Äì Racing Red and Sinister Black.

44,Qbc0okKUv-,How do they make bicycle frames? Bike Frame production line. www.metal-bike.com,"How do they make bicycle frames?
How is a bike frame made?

What is the best material for a bike frame?

Steel. The most traditional frame material, steel has been used by frame builders for over a century.

Aluminum. Aluminum was first used in frame construction in 1895.

Titanium. Titanium (also called ""ti"") is one of the longest lasting, strongest, and most expensive frame materials.

Carbon Fiber.

Why is Aluminium used for bicycles?

Due to their durability, rust resistance, stability and low weight, aluminum frames can suit the needs of a range of riders. 

While the benefits of an aluminum frame may not compare with those of some titanium and carbon fiber bikes, frames made with aluminum are substantially less expensive.

Frames can also be made from even bamboo and cardboard.

How is a bike frame made? 
What is the best material for a bike frame?

 Steel. The most traditional frame material, steel has been used by frame builders for over a century. 

Aluminum. Aluminum was first used in frame construction in 1895. 

Titanium. Titanium (also called ""ti"") is one of the longest lasting, strongest, and most expensive frame materials. 

Carbon Fiber.

 Why is Aluminium used for bicycles? Due to their durability, rust resistance, stability and low weight, aluminum frames can suit the needs of a range of riders.

Additive manufacturing and 3-D printing both posed their very own special challenges to the production process, especially when it came to processing the frame components, where a reduction in the bike's weight was targeted by using less material. This meant that the remaining material for machining was quite minimal, in some places only 2 mm thick.

For Scott Bradley, application engineer at WNT, this meant rethinking the processing strategies to be used in this project: ‚ÄúConventional titanium machining strategies tell us that climb milling is the optimal solution to obtaining a hard surface on the material.

In preparation for this project, the initial tests we performed indicated that conventional milling was the best option for these parts, in terms of the depth of cut, clamping and the thin walls of the metal.

To maximise the processing power, WNT opted to use its A 2011 indexable milling cutter that had been developed as an alternative to solid carbide cutters, with a diameter between 16 and 40 mm. [The series extends to 80 mm diameter.

110,CUW7ZgCP0tY,Knox and Bike Social talk UK manufacturing.,"Aaron Travell from Knox interviews Jim Lindsay of Bike Social regarding his UK manufacturing articles that he will be producing over the coming weeks on Knox and other UK manufacturers. The discussion covers many elements of UK manufacturing.

At Knox we believe our UK manufacturing adds real value to customers for 3 main reasons.

INNOVATION

We have the in-house skills to design, develop and actually make new cutting edge products. Examples of this innovation would be our new layering system; a brand new innovation in motorcycle clothing including a revolutionary dual fitting clothing system in our outer garments, that changes the way that motorcyclists wear their clothing.

QUALITY

Our UK manufacturing means that we keep a close eye on the quality every day. By applying efficient LEAN manufacturing principles we also make in much smaller batches than Far Eastern manufacturers, meaning that we can control quality to a much closer level and also if there becomes a problem, we can fix it very quickly rather than flooding the market with products that are not quite right.

SPEED TO RESPOND

Our UK manufacturing means that we are quick to develop or improve products. An example of this would be our Zephyr jacket, the perfect summer riding jacket, which is made in the UK and is the result of many requests.

We are also now able to offer an alteration service for the new denim jean collection and also a quick repair service if it is needed.
Overall, we feel that UK manufacturing helps give Knox an edge and improved service for riders and therefore, irrespective of the cost and hard work to operate it, we are incredibly proud to have it.",Manufacturing

Yamaha RX100 is a 98cc 2-stroke single cylinder air-cooled motorcycle. It was Escorts Limited's ""Bread and Butter"" model for close to 12 years between 1985 and 1996. A nippy motorcycle with great handling, it was an instant hit with the masses. A great machine, all that was ever changed in the 11-year production history were the pinstriping and an upgrade to a 12-volt electrical system.

153,Q4AuIFqneUU,Royal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant - Chennai,"Royal Enfield Manufacturing Process Plant Chennai / Full bullet making process /RE Plant Channai

Royal Enfield has begun commercial production at its new manufacturing facility at Vallam Vadagal near Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Spread over 50 acres, the plant is the bike maker's third manufacturing facility and will manufacture Royal Enfield motorcycles for India and international markets.

Construction of the new facility started 15 months back and has been completed in record time. The new facility has been benchmarked to the highest level of quality and productivity. The manufacturing capacity in this facility will enable the company to meet its next level of growth.

In the first phase, the state-of-the-art plant kicks off with an installed production capacity of 300,000 motorcycles. In FY2017-18, the combined production capacity from all the three plants is planned to be 8,25,000 units. In FY2016-17, Royal Enfield produced and sold 6,67,135 motorcycles, nearing its installed capacity. The company‚Äôs sales have grown at a compounded rate of over 55 percent over the past six years. According to Royal Enfield, its order book continues to be strong and there is a large unmet demand. In FY2017-18, it plans to invest Rs 800 crore, largely towards capacity expansion at Vallam Vadagal, new products and platforms, and setting up of technical centres in Leicester, UK and Chennai, India. This investment will be funded through internal accruals.

Recently, Bajaj Auto formed an alliance with Triumph Motorcycles to enter the mid-sized motorcycle space. There are a number of other domestic OEMs also eyeing this segment. The capacity expansion is also part of Royal Enfield‚Äôs strategy to prepare itself to face competition.

As an absolute first in its class, the 390 DUKE boasts a glorious TFT display. This multicolor combination of relevant information presents all relevant data in a clear-cut, uncluttered way. As you rev the engine, the display bars change color, either spurring you on or telling you to back off when the engine‚Äôs still cold. The display also automatically adapts its illumination to the ambient ligh. Form and function are integrated beautifully in the 390 DUKE. Take the LED headlight for example, a highlight in this bike‚Äôs design and a clear referral to the 1290 SUPER DUKE R. It combines optimal illumination of the near field with maximum light output. And the parking light, which consists of 20 LEDs, ensures that the motorcycle is perceived better and is more differentiated by other traffic users, thus offering massive safety benefits.

Grab yourself a brew, sit back and watch this enchanting video of a Rover motorcycle being constructed back in the good old days of hand crafted machinery.  From casting the cylinders to machining the crank and assembling the engine, this a wonderful insight into the vintage days of building motorcycles for the road.  And keep your eye out for the test rider who hits the water feature with a little bit too much gusto!

The Rover company began to develop and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle with the engine in the centre and 'springer' front forks, an improvement ahead of its time. The first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, a bottom-bracket engine, and mechanically operated valves. Featuring a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904.

TVS Apache RR 310 by TVS Motor launch
Unveiling the new TVS Apache RR 310 at the launch, Mr. Sudarshan Venu, Joint Managing Director, TVS Motor Company said, ‚ÄúThe launch of TVS Apache RR 310 marks a major milestone, as it ushers in a new era at TVS Motor Company. Our endeavour is to fulfill the aspirations of discerning customers by offering high-quality, technologically-innovative products. The TVS Apache RR 310 is the most advanced and exclusive offering in our product portfolio, as it is a manifestation of 35 years of learnings from the race track, coupled with cutting-edge technology. We are confident that customers will find it to be a perfect combination of racecraft technology and riding dynamics.‚Äù
Speaking at the launch, Mr. KN Radhakrishnan, President & Chief Executive Officer, TVS Motor Company, said, ‚ÄúToday is a proud moment for us at TVS Motor Company. Driven by our promise of delivering more to customers than their expectations, TVS Apache RR 310 is the beginning of our breakthrough into the super-premium category. We started building our premium brand - Apache RTR with 150cc and succeeded in raising the customer aspirations with 180cc and 200cc bikes. TVS Apache RR 310 is another step in our effort to deliver beyond customers‚Äô expectations and offering them a chance to upgrade from premium to super-premium category.‚Äù 
The TVS Apache RR 310 gets a 312cc, single-cylinder, 4-stroke, 4-valve, liquid-cooled engine that churns out 34 PS@9700 rpm and 27.3 NM@7700 rpm. The engine is mated to a 6-speed super-slick gear box that offers a precise and sharp race-shift experience. The motorcycle boasts of a top speed of 160 kmph, and acceleration from 0-to-60 kmph in just 2.9 seconds, thanks to an advanced aerodynamics package that promises the lowest coefficient of drag in this segment.
Staying true to 35 years of TVS Racing pedigree, TVS Apache RR 310 comes with an all-new, race origin, light-weight trellis-frame chassis for enhanced stiffness in straights, and flex for dynamic cornering capability, that result in best-in-class riding dynamics. The motorcycle uses a unique reverse inclined DOHC (double overhead cam) engine with LCOC (liquid-cooled oil coolant) technology. This facilitates a compact layout for an ideal power-to-weight ratio and better mass centralization.
The TVS Apache RR 310 is equipped with a race-inspired vertical speedo-cum-tachometer with 18 racing tell-tale diagnostics, and a comprehensive post-ride analysis. The motorcycle is fitted with first-in-class bi-LED twin projector head lamps for maximum reach and visibility. It is also outfitted with Michelin Street Sport tyres, and is the first sub-500cc motorcycle to use these.
TVS Apache RR 310 sports a fully-faired, sporty design with superior ergonomics to ensure maximum ride comfort. The Thermal Management System on the motorcycle is fitted with a special gill profile to shield the rider‚Äôs leg from engine heat, and aids better heat dissipation. To accentuate the handling and ride experience, the TVS Apache RR 310 gets the Race Spec KYB Suspension that is tested and tuned by MotoGP experts. Both, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) and Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system, will be available as standard on the TVS Apache RR 310. The motorcycle comes in 2 impressive colours ‚Äì Racing Red and Sinister Black.

180,Qbc0okKUv-,How do they make bicycle frames? Bike Frame production line. www.metal-bike.com,"How do they make bicycle frames?
How is a bike frame made?

What is the best material for a bike frame?

Steel. The most traditional frame material, steel has been used by frame builders for over a century.

Aluminum. Aluminum was first used in frame construction in 1895.

Titanium. Titanium (also called ""ti"") is one of the longest lasting, strongest, and most expensive frame materials.

Carbon Fiber.

Why is Aluminium used for bicycles?

Due to their durability, rust resistance, stability and low weight, aluminum frames can suit the needs of a range of riders. 

While the benefits of an aluminum frame may not compare with those of some titanium and carbon fiber bikes, frames made with aluminum are substantially less expensive.

Frames can also be made from even bamboo and cardboard.

225,MAwW0i9WrY,Professional Aluminum Bike Frame Production Line. www.metal-bike.com,"How do they make bicycle frames? 
How is a bike frame made? 
What is the best material for a bike frame?

 Steel. The most traditional frame material, steel has been used by frame builders for over a century. 

Aluminum. Aluminum was first used in frame construction in 1895. 

Titanium. Titanium (also called ""ti"") is one of the longest lasting, strongest, and most expensive frame materials. 

Carbon Fiber.

 Why is Aluminium used for bicycles? Due to their durability, rust resistance, stability and low weight, aluminum frames can suit the needs of a range of riders. 

While the benefits of an aluminum frame may not compare with those of some titanium and carbon fiber bikes, frames made with aluminum are substantially less expensive. 

Frames can also be made from even bamboo and cardboard.

Additive manufacturing and 3-D printing both posed their very own special challenges to the production process, especially when it came to processing the frame components, where a reduction in the bike's weight was targeted by using less material. This meant that the remaining material for machining was quite minimal, in some places only 2 mm thick.

For Scott Bradley, application engineer at WNT, this meant rethinking the processing strategies to be used in this project: ‚ÄúConventional titanium machining strategies tell us that climb milling is the optimal solution to obtaining a hard surface on the material.

In preparation for this project, the initial tests we performed indicated that conventional milling was the best option for these parts, in terms of the depth of cut, clamping and the thin walls of the metal.

To maximise the processing power, WNT opted to use its A 2011 indexable milling cutter that had been developed as an alternative to solid carbide cutters, with a diameter between 16 and 40 mm. [The series extends to 80 mm diameter.

246,CUW7ZgCP0tY,Knox and Bike Social talk UK manufacturing.,"Aaron Travell from Knox interviews Jim Lindsay of Bike Social regarding his UK manufacturing articles that he will be producing over the coming weeks on Knox and other UK manufacturers. The discussion covers many elements of UK manufacturing.

At Knox we believe our UK manufacturing adds real value to customers for 3 main reasons.

INNOVATION

We have the in-house skills to design, develop and actually make new cutting edge products. Examples of this innovation would be our new layering system; a brand new innovation in motorcycle clothing including a revolutionary dual fitting clothing system in our outer garments, that changes the way that motorcyclists wear their clothing.

QUALITY

Our UK manufacturing means that we keep a close eye on the quality every day. By applying efficient LEAN manufacturing principles we also make in much smaller batches than Far Eastern manufacturers, meaning that we can control quality to a much closer level and also if there becomes a problem, we can fix it very quickly rather than flooding the market with products that are not quite right.

SPEED TO RESPOND

Our UK manufacturing means that we are quick to develop or improve products. An example of this would be our Zephyr jacket, the perfect summer riding jacket, which is made in the UK and is the result of many requests.

We are also now able to offer an alteration service for the new denim jean collection and also a quick repair service if it is needed.
Overall, we feel that UK manufacturing helps give Knox an edge and improved service for riders and therefore, irrespective of the cost and hard work to operate it, we are incredibly proud to have it.",Manufacturing
