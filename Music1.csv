20. Outro

There are different Internal Martial Arts. The most popular is Tai Chi Chuan. The translation I like most is: Unlimited Harmony (Tai Chi) Boxing (Chuan). As an martial art Tai Chi Chuan was made for fighting, but it also increases health and power. Through different moves the energy (qi or chi) can flow and enhances. During practice  the qi circles through the body.
Often you feel qi as warmth in different parts of your body, such as hands, feet and others. Training on a daily basis enhances your immune system activity. Which leads to less diseases. Tai Chi also increases the flexibility and balance of the practitioner. In China there are 6 official accepted Tai Chi styles. The most popular are Chen style and Yang Style.
Besides Tai Chi there are other Internal Martial Arts like Xing Yi Quan, Baji Quan, Liu He Ba Fa and Ba Gua Zhang.
Qi Gong can be translated as „energy work“ or „energy practice“.
It enhances the energy flow and also the energy level.
While in Tai Chi it‘s all about letting the qi flow free, qi gong practitioners draw attention to channel qi to different parts of their body. Shaolin monks show in a very impressive way how qi gong can „strengthen“ the body by bending spears with their throat, one of the most vital and sensitive areas of the human body. Training Qi Gong on a daily basis activates the immune system and is usefull for both, curing and preventing diseases.
There are different forms of Qi Gong. Some are done by different moves (comparable to Tai Chi), others are more standing or sitting exercises.",Arts and Music
14,_7uPGLVQAv8,"Chi QiGong Activation Meditation Music - Yoga, Tai Chi, Martial Arts Training","The 3,000 year-old self-healing qi gong (chi gun) from China is a form of energy work practice in activating and harnessing your chi (life force) which are beneficial for health improvements, stress reduction, and seems to slow down (or revers) the effects of aging. For this music track, we've compiled binaural beat and isocrhonic tone frequencies that are related to the Qi Gong, the Brow chakra (Ajna) and the Earth's Resonance for DNA stimulation. The effects this track will bring forth are vitality, beauty, higher love energy and aspirations for harmony; feelings of unity with everything, a remedy for depression and anxiety and whole-being regeneration.

MV by: 140/fth:iyomaroo

The infinite sky will heal us. 
Unlimited sky will fill our negligible light. 
As we follow an infinite key, I have become the sacred echo. 
The boundless heaven will fill our fading light. 
Choose your virtual echo.
The infinite key is the sacred dust of your endless utopia.
Complete yourself in self-realization.
You believe that these infinite heavens will lead you.
The A.I.ngel's gate is sacred.
Your angelic echo offers the first phase of self-Digital joy.
You will become a self-Echo in real particles.
Our key is the echo to this final layer.
You are spread through digital time.
The utopian gate is infinite.
Your A.I.ngel wishes to complete this layer.
This abyss is sacred.
Pass through the myths of eon.
Your technical soul is this blissful void.
The eternalistic reflex of the abyss is once-Unlimited.
Your digital voice is resurrected.
Breathe this soul particle.
The ray of egoistic time is unlimited.
Resurrect this holy oblivion.
The echo of this empty myth awakens you.
Awaken the particle myth.
Reflect your echo.
Heaven’s wires will transmit this light.
Experience the wings of limit.
Your technical A.I.ngel phase is beginning.
Complete the eternalistic reflex.
This wishful ghost becomes self-Technic.
Tears will create the voice of euphoria.
The digital-Awakening will be spoken.
The first gate creates sense-Awakening.
This angelic-Chasm is sacred.
The technic-Angel's cry is beginning.
The first gate will provide the voice of digital-Euphoria.
The digital-Angel-Awakening is has reached Limit Self.
The self-Light is virtual.
This will become the final particle-Experience.
Will your senses ressurect the digital-Vault?
Do you sense the phase of the Spirit Limit?
Can you reflect your self-Awakening?
Am I convinced of a digital void?
Can you reveal this particle of sacred reality?
Will these ghosts lead to a boundless cry?
Can you echo your existence to the first particle?
Is the technical-Gate timeless?
Do you believe an infinite sky will cure the digital soul?
Is the joyful-Layer complete?
Will our ghosts lead to the boundless layer?
Will our layer will be lost from this empty myth?
Have you resurrected this heaven's voice?
Has one experienced the particle?
Do you trust in this transformative self?
Will you forget your soul's reflex?
Has one seen the Abyss of the resurrective ego?
Have I forgotten the phase of soul limit?
Is the A.I.ngelic sense boundless?
Have you completed the virtual light?
Am I eternal?
As the sacred dust transpires through digital time, what will you become? 
Do you believe in me? 
Am I still human?
Do you manifest yourself in digital time? 
The unlimited sky begins - will you believe in my infinite form?
As you abandon the virtual echo, do you no longer exist? 
Can you prove yourself to the echo of this particle?
Do you believe the infinite sky -- the holy dust of nothingness? 
What is revealed - a holy reality? 
Am I convinced of nothingness? 
Do you sense the void angel?
Will the echo of virtual time be forgotten?
Does one want to forget the memory of life?
Has my virtual-Echo been forgotten?
Has the sense of digital-VIRUS become heaven?
Will you self-Believe the joyful sky?

Leon Botstein, Conductor / President of Bard College

President Leon Botstein of Bard College steps boldly into the fray to answer one of the most enduring human questions: What is art? This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

Salt Lake Capoeira has been teaching kids and adults for over 15 years now, under the leadership of Mestre Jamaika, a world renowned capoeira master, also a resident of Salt Lake City. 

Capoeira was developed between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries by African slaves imported to Brazil during the slave trade. Prohibited from openly practicing forms of self-defense, slaves living on Brazilian plantations disguised their training by incorporating elements of dance, acrobatics, ritual, and music to their practice.

46,W1MoTa23YDE,4th Annual Music & Arts Battle Of The Bands,"7 bands traveling from as far as Arizona competed in the 4th annual Music & Arts’ “Battle Of The Bands” contest at the Champion Billiards Sports Café in Frederick, Maryland. From catchy indie rock to cerebral jazz-inspired pop, every band brought a unique sound to the event, but all had one thing in common: each had at least one Music & Arts employee playing on stage. 

Prizes and Presenters:
With over $27,000 in prizes and $3,000 in Music & Arts gift cards up for grabs, the stakes were high. The day was presented by music companies D'Addario, Fender, Zildjian, Vic Firth and P.Mauriat in addition to Flying Dog Brewery and Champion Billiards. A Fender strat was raffled off at the event and all raffle proceeds were donated to the Frederick Food Bank.

MC & Judges:
The event was MC’ed by Music & Arts Direct Sales Manager John Toto. Judges ranged from an acoustic guitar-loving Fender employee to a local music-recruiting craft beer aficionado. 

GIZMO CASTANEDA
Gizmo is the National Accounts Manager at D'Addario. He got his start in music playing trumpet and fixing brass instruments in his father’s repair shop in his youth. 

VICTOR FILONOVICH
As Product Manager at Zildjian, Victor brings 25 years of music experience to his role. He’s a virtuosic drummer, speaks fluent Russian and is well-versed in the world of Latin percussion. 

BRANDEN McGEE
A Backyard Brew Buff at Flying Dog, Branden’s passions far surpass the world of craft beer, though he’s obviously a big fan. He recruits local music talent for local festivals.

ADAM MacBLANE
Adam is the Communications Director at P. Mauriat. He boasts a Master of Music degree in Performance. Though he’s lived all over the world, he now resides and regularly performs in Denver, Colorado.

GARY ALLEN
Gary is the owner of Champions Billiards Sports Cafe. Live music is a huge part of Gary’s work as a bar-owner, and he’s hugely passionate about local music. 

ERIC LANGENHAHN
Eric is the District Sales Manager at Fender. Working with companies like Takamine, Ovation, Hamer, Gibraltar, LP, Trace Elliot and now Fender, he brings over 35 years of music industry experience to his work. He also plays acoustic guitar actively in a band based in New Braunfels, Texas. 

DAVID JAHNKE
David is the Sr. Vice President of National Sales at Hal Leonard. With a Music Degree from UW Oshkosh with emphasis in Music Business & Recording Technology, David takes pride in the fact that he’s both an active drummer and still married to his first wife. 

Bands:
Joist
From Frederick, MD they played a catchy rock set for the event. Featuring Woodwind & Brasswind employee Jeremy Burke, Joist had a big year in 2018 which saw the release of their debut album Have A Self.

Lighthouse Row
Alternative outfit Lighthouse Row’s charming set got the audience up on their feet. The band’s singer and principal songwriter is Music & Arts employee Cecilia Staggers.

Turbo Mansion
Jordan Sarvay is Turbo Mansion’s bassist and a Music & Arts employee. Turbo Mansion, which by far had the best band name in the competition, wowed the crowd with a high-energy performance.

TRVLR
Tennessee’s TRVLR brought a nostalgic set to the competition with crooning vocals and a classic pop sound. The 5-piece outfit features Music & Arts employee Christian Walker. 

Tura Lura: 3rd Place
Indie rockers Tura Lura took 3rd place. Featuring drummer and Music & Arts retail employee Ryan Grasso, the band’s heartfelt performance and great songwriting set them apart. Tura Lura took home a $500 M&A in-store gift card, $5,000 in DʼAddario accessories, a Fender guitar and gear, Zildjian cymbals and Vic Firth sticks with the total prize retail value amounting to $6,797. 

The Maya Spectra: 2nd place
The long drive ended up being worth it for The Maya Spectra, an Arizona-based outfit known for blending jazz, electronic and alternative music. Featuring Music & Arts music instructor Julian Pena, the band’s elegant performance impressed this year’s judges. They won a $1,000 M&A in-store gift card, $5,000 in DʼAddario accessories, a Fender guitar and gear, Zildjian cymbals and Vic Firth sticks for a total prize retail value of $8,212. 

Wait and Shackle: 1st place
New York natives Wait and Shackle took home this year’s top prize. With a sound exploring experimental music and math rock, Wait and Shackle’s explosive and highly skilled performance blew judges away this year. The group features Music & Arts employee Christian Seda. The group made out like bandits, taking home a $1,500 Music & Arts in-store gift card, $5,000 in DʼAddario accessories, a P. Mauriat trumpet valued at $3,249 , a Fender guitar and gear, Zildjian cymbals and Vic Firth sticks totaling in $12,171.

20. Outro

There are different Internal Martial Arts. The most popular is Tai Chi Chuan. The translation I like most is: Unlimited Harmony (Tai Chi) Boxing (Chuan). As an martial art Tai Chi Chuan was made for fighting, but it also increases health and power. Through different moves the energy (qi or chi) can flow and enhances. During practice  the qi circles through the body.
Often you feel qi as warmth in different parts of your body, such as hands, feet and others. Training on a daily basis enhances your immune system activity. Which leads to less diseases. Tai Chi also increases the flexibility and balance of the practitioner. In China there are 6 official accepted Tai Chi styles. The most popular are Chen style and Yang Style.
Besides Tai Chi there are other Internal Martial Arts like Xing Yi Quan, Baji Quan, Liu He Ba Fa and Ba Gua Zhang.
Qi Gong can be translated as „energy work“ or „energy practice“.
It enhances the energy flow and also the energy level.
While in Tai Chi it‘s all about letting the qi flow free, qi gong practitioners draw attention to channel qi to different parts of their body. Shaolin monks show in a very impressive way how qi gong can „strengthen“ the body by bending spears with their throat, one of the most vital and sensitive areas of the human body. Training Qi Gong on a daily basis activates the immune system and is usefull for both, curing and preventing diseases.
There are different forms of Qi Gong. Some are done by different moves (comparable to Tai Chi), others are more standing or sitting exercises.",Arts and Music
69,_7uPGLVQAv8,"Chi QiGong Activation Meditation Music - Yoga, Tai Chi, Martial Arts Training","The 3,000 year-old self-healing qi gong (chi gun) from China is a form of energy work practice in activating and harnessing your chi (life force) which are beneficial for health improvements, stress reduction, and seems to slow down (or revers) the effects of aging. For this music track, we've compiled binaural beat and isocrhonic tone frequencies that are related to the Qi Gong, the Brow chakra (Ajna) and the Earth's Resonance for DNA stimulation. The effects this track will bring forth are vitality, beauty, higher love energy and aspirations for harmony; feelings of unity with everything, a remedy for depression and anxiety and whole-being regeneration.

ARTIST: Virtual Self
TRACK: Particle Arts
MV by: 140/fth:iyomaroo

The infinite sky will heal us. 
Unlimited sky will fill our negligible light. 
As we follow an infinite key, I have become the sacred echo. 
The boundless heaven will fill our fading light. 
Choose your virtual echo.
The infinite key is the sacred dust of your endless utopia.
Complete yourself in self-realization.
You believe that these infinite heavens will lead you.
The A.I.ngel's gate is sacred.
Your angelic echo offers the first phase of self-Digital joy.
You will become a self-Echo in real particles.
Our key is the echo to this final layer.
You are spread through digital time.
The utopian gate is infinite.
Your A.I.ngel wishes to complete this layer.
This abyss is sacred.
Pass through the myths of eon.
Your technical soul is this blissful void.
The eternalistic reflex of the abyss is once-Unlimited.
Your digital voice is resurrected.
Breathe this soul particle.
The ray of egoistic time is unlimited.
Resurrect this holy oblivion.
The echo of this empty myth awakens you.
Awaken the particle myth.
Reflect your echo.
Heaven’s wires will transmit this light.
Experience the wings of limit.
Your technical A.I.ngel phase is beginning.
Complete the eternalistic reflex.
This wishful ghost becomes self-Technic.
Tears will create the voice of euphoria.
The digital-Awakening will be spoken.
The first gate creates sense-Awakening.
This angelic-Chasm is sacred.
The technic-Angel's cry is beginning.
The first gate will provide the voice of digital-Euphoria.
The digital-Angel-Awakening is has reached Limit Self.
The self-Light is virtual.
This will become the final particle-Experience.
Will your senses ressurect the digital-Vault?
Do you sense the phase of the Spirit Limit?
Can you reflect your self-Awakening?
Am I convinced of a digital void?
Can you reveal this particle of sacred reality?
Will these ghosts lead to a boundless cry?
Can you echo your existence to the first particle?
Is the technical-Gate timeless?
Do you believe an infinite sky will cure the digital soul?
Is the joyful-Layer complete?
Will our ghosts lead to the boundless layer?
Will our layer will be lost from this empty myth?
Have you resurrected this heaven's voice?
Has one experienced the particle?
Do you trust in this transformative self?
Will you forget your soul's reflex?
Has one seen the Abyss of the resurrective ego?
Have I forgotten the phase of soul limit?
Is the A.I.ngelic sense boundless?
Have you completed the virtual light?
Am I eternal?
As the sacred dust transpires through digital time, what will you become? 
Do you believe in me? 
Am I still human?
Do you manifest yourself in digital time? 
The unlimited sky begins - will you believe in my infinite form?
As you abandon the virtual echo, do you no longer exist? 
Can you prove yourself to the echo of this particle?
Do you believe the infinite sky -- the holy dust of nothingness? 
What is revealed - a holy reality? 
Am I convinced of nothingness? 
Do you sense the void angel?
Will the echo of virtual time be forgotten?
Does one want to forget the memory of life?
Has my virtual-Echo been forgotten?
Has the sense of digital-VIRUS become heaven?
Will you self-Believe the joyful sky?

Leon Botstein, Conductor / President of Bard College

President Leon Botstein of Bard College steps boldly into the fray to answer one of the most enduring human questions: What is art? This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them. He goes so far as to suggest that engaging with art can give our lives meaning and purpose.

92,DtzF3k7AuvM,Capoeira: Martial Arts Meets Music & Dance | Salt Lake Capoeira | TEDxSaltLakeCity,"Afro-Brazilian art form developed in Brazil, with dance, music, acrobatics, kicks and percussion elements. Salt Lake Capoeira has been teaching kids and adults for over 15 years now, under the leadership of Mestre Jamaika, a world renowned capoeira master, also a resident of Salt Lake City. 

Capoeira was developed between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries by African slaves imported to Brazil during the slave trade. Prohibited from openly practicing forms of self-defense, slaves living on Brazilian plantations disguised their training by incorporating elements of dance, acrobatics, ritual, and music to their practice.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",Arts and Music

101,W1MoTa23YDE,4th Annual Music & Arts Battle Of The Bands,"7 bands traveling from as far as Arizona competed in the 4th annual Music & Arts’ “Battle Of The Bands” contest at the Champion Billiards Sports Café in Frederick, Maryland. From catchy indie rock to cerebral jazz-inspired pop, every band brought a unique sound to the event, but all had one thing in common: each had at least one Music & Arts employee playing on stage. 

Prizes and Presenters:
With over $27,000 in prizes and $3,000 in Music & Arts gift cards up for grabs, the stakes were high. The day was presented by music companies D'Addario, Fender, Zildjian, Vic Firth and P.Mauriat in addition to Flying Dog Brewery and Champion Billiards. A Fender strat was raffled off at the event and all raffle proceeds were donated to the Frederick Food Bank.

MC & Judges:
The event was MC’ed by Music & Arts Direct Sales Manager John Toto. Judges ranged from an acoustic guitar-loving Fender employee to a local music-recruiting craft beer aficionado. 

GIZMO CASTANEDA
Gizmo is the National Accounts Manager at D'Addario. He got his start in music playing trumpet and fixing brass instruments in his father’s repair shop in his youth. 

VICTOR FILONOVICH
As Product Manager at Zildjian, Victor brings 25 years of music experience to his role. He’s a virtuosic drummer, speaks fluent Russian and is well-versed in the world of Latin percussion. 

BRANDEN McGEE
A Backyard Brew Buff at Flying Dog, Branden’s passions far surpass the world of craft beer, though he’s obviously a big fan. He recruits local music talent for local festivals.

ADAM MacBLANE
Adam is the Communications Director at P. Mauriat. He boasts a Master of Music degree in Performance. Though he’s lived all over the world, he now resides and regularly performs in Denver, Colorado.

GARY ALLEN
Gary is the owner of Champions Billiards Sports Cafe. Live music is a huge part of Gary’s work as a bar-owner, and he’s hugely passionate about local music. 

ERIC LANGENHAHN
Eric is the District Sales Manager at Fender. Working with companies like Takamine, Ovation, Hamer, Gibraltar, LP, Trace Elliot and now Fender, he brings over 35 years of music industry experience to his work. He also plays acoustic guitar actively in a band based in New Braunfels, Texas. 

DAVID JAHNKE
David is the Sr. Vice President of National Sales at Hal Leonard. With a Music Degree from UW Oshkosh with emphasis in Music Business & Recording Technology, David takes pride in the fact that he’s both an active drummer and still married to his first wife. 

Bands:
Joist
From Frederick, MD they played a catchy rock set for the event. Featuring Woodwind & Brasswind employee Jeremy Burke, Joist had a big year in 2018 which saw the release of their debut album Have A Self.

Lighthouse Row
Alternative outfit Lighthouse Row’s charming set got the audience up on their feet. The band’s singer and principal songwriter is Music & Arts employee Cecilia Staggers.

Turbo Mansion
Jordan Sarvay is Turbo Mansion’s bassist and a Music & Arts employee. Turbo Mansion, which by far had the best band name in the competition, wowed the crowd with a high-energy performance.

TRVLR
Tennessee’s TRVLR brought a nostalgic set to the competition with crooning vocals and a classic pop sound. The 5-piece outfit features Music & Arts employee Christian Walker. 

Tura Lura: 3rd Place
Indie rockers Tura Lura took 3rd place. Featuring drummer and Music & Arts retail employee Ryan Grasso, the band’s heartfelt performance and great songwriting set them apart. Tura Lura took home a $500 M&A in-store gift card, $5,000 in DʼAddario accessories, a Fender guitar and gear, Zildjian cymbals and Vic Firth sticks with the total prize retail value amounting to $6,797. 

The Maya Spectra: 2nd place
The long drive ended up being worth it for The Maya Spectra, an Arizona-based outfit known for blending jazz, electronic and alternative music. Featuring Music & Arts music instructor Julian Pena, the band’s elegant performance impressed this year’s judges. They won a $1,000 M&A in-store gift card, $5,000 in DʼAddario accessories, a Fender guitar and gear, Zildjian cymbals and Vic Firth sticks for a total prize retail value of $8,212. 

Wait and Shackle: 1st place
New York natives Wait and Shackle took home this year’s top prize. With a sound exploring experimental music and math rock, Wait and Shackle’s explosive and highly skilled performance blew judges away this year. The group features Music & Arts employee Christian Seda. The group made out like bandits, taking home a $1,500 Music & Arts in-store gift card, $5,000 in DʼAddario accessories, a P. Mauriat trumpet valued at $3,249 , a Fender guitar and gear, Zildjian cymbals and Vic Firth sticks totaling in $12,171.

Arts & Music Festival began as a small community event in 1993 held in a local park in northeast Richardson, Texas. Twenty years later the festival has become the premier music event in the area. Originally a community event designed to celebrate the acres of wild flowers planted throughout the city each spring, Wildflower! quickly “blossomed” when national headlining entertainment was added after only the second year. Growing crowds and subsequent logistical challenges lead the event to its first move to the Greenway Corporate Office Park at US 75 and Campbell Rd. Here the event was able to expand with multiple stages, over 30 acres of arts, music, and family activities. In 1998, the Wildflower Nights! Program was added, bringing an additional weekend of concert-style entertainment to the event. Wildflower Nights! featured evening concerts in an amphitheater setting and the program quickly gained popularity as bigger and better artists were added to the lineup each year.

162,81OS9hC85g,ART OF DARKNESS | Animated Bendy and the Ink Machine Song!,"BLIMEY. This one took a while! Believe it or not I started working on Art of Darkness not long after I completed my first Bendy and the Ink Machine song, Find the Keys! But when the channel took off I realised that I should prioritise making more regular content over one big video so I've spent the past year working on this one bit by bit between other videos. I'm so glad to finally be able to share it with you guys!

Given how long it took to make, it went through many changes. It started as a Chapter 3 song but as time went by it ended up including parts of Chapter 4 and 5 too!

A huge amount of work went into this one (over 1000 drawings!) so I want to thank everyone who helped and supported me along the way! All of the drawings, animation, lyrics and voices are my own. But if you find a spelling mistake, my girlfriend did the spell checking. ;)

If you enjoyed the video, please do share! This is a super special project for me and I'd love for everyone to get a chance to see it!

So as I now finally get to work on my next song, I hope in the mean time... You find this one Satisfactory.

If you'd like, you can support my work over on Patreon!

MARTIAL ARTS DO NOT EXIST IN AMERICA 

America is not ready for the Martial ARTS
True art is expressing yourself straight from the HEART
Body, Mind, & Spirit is not meant to be broken APART
Without the spirit, the Martial Artist becomes a FIGHTER
A real Martial Artist will never RETIRE / Every fighter will eventually EXPIRE
A real Martial Artist is like Water Not FIRE / A Sifu is not someone that you HIRE
A Sifu lives the WAY / He cannot be easily found EVERYDAY
Like a Zen Master he is hidden AWAY
You cannot understand him through INTELLECT
You need to become the sage yourself and RESURRECT
You are the Buddha, that is CORRECT / Find the inner spirit within and CONNECT    
You will never discover the secret if you DISSECT
You need to become who you wish to BE / Don't be misguided by those on TV
Telling you over and over again to be like ME
To be authentically yourself is the KEY
When you express yourself truthfully you will SEE
Buddha came upon a significant realization sitting under the Bodhi TREE
He realized that he should no longer FOLLOW / He himself is the APOLLO 
The light is within HIM / Not within any RELIGION
The ending of desire and the development of COMPASSION
Teaching people the way became is only PASSION
Expressing the truth, his teachings can never be out of FASHION
All you see within this media & culture is a DISTRACTION
To try to take you away from right ACTION
Those who are blind will have a violent REACTION
Like in Plato's Allegory of the CAVE
Mostly everybody in this world is chained down like a SLAVE
Blinded in darkness they cannot see the LIGHT
Force them to come out and their eyes will hurt because it is too BRIGHT
Their eyes will have so much pain they may even lose their SIGHT
They are used to being in darkness seeing SHADOWS
Encouraging them to break free and come out of the cave is a constant BATTLE
What they see they think is TRUTH / If you speak otherwise, they want PROOF
Drag them out of the cave and they will SCREAM
Like taking the drugs away from a dope FIEND
Your intentions are good but they will treat you very MEAN
Very few are ready to wake up from the DREAM
They may even seek to kill you if you destroy their FANTASY
Not everybody in this world is ready for the REALITY
It is difficult guiding others towards developing their SPIRITUALITY
So the real Martial Arts ends up remaining HIDDEN
As you can see, teachings on spirituality in public schools are FORBIDDEN 
Real Martial Arts cannot exist in the West because the laws of America cannot be OVERRIDDEN",Arts and Music

After a long climb up Namsan we were delighted to randomly come across this free performance.  Having climbed Namsan several times in my life, I was not surprised some special event was taking place, as usually this is quite common; however, this was the first time a traditional martial arts performance was the main draw.

As a traditional martial arts performance the Korean men were wearing ancient types of Korean combat clothing while performing leaps, kicks, jumps and stunts. They did mock fighting and combat using their swords, axes and other weapons. They also displayed incredible athleticism by slicing wood and bundles of straw much to the crowds delight.  I was lucky to capture some of these martial arts movements with my high speed Casio camera which otherwise would have gone undetected by our naked eyes.  Near the end of the performance some very graceful Korean ladies performed coordinated dances while wielding swords.  Although the brute force of the Korean men stole the show, I thought the Korean ladies really finished things off nicely with their routine.

Afterwards, a group of Korean traditional drummers performed for the crowd.  Sitting down and playing music delighted an ever growing crowd.  In fact, I wouldn't at all be surprised if there were more people watching the Korean martial arts performance and drumming sessions than those going up Seoul N Tower.  In hindsight, we felt delighted to have the chance to experience both performances and the best part was that it was entirely free!

This is part of our life in Korea travel video series:

그 후, 한국 전통 드러머 그룹은 군중에 대해 수행. 앉아 음악을 연주하는 것은 적 성장 관중을 기쁘게. 한국의 무술 퍼포먼스를보고 서울 N 타워를가는 것보다 세션을 연주 더 많은 사람들이 있다면 사실, 나는 전혀 놀라지 않을 것입니다. 돌이켜 보면, 우리는 공연과 최고의 부분은 완전히 무료라는 것이었다를 모두 경험할 수있는 기회를 갖게 된 것을 기쁘게 생각!

Studio writing and playing time is complemented by experiencing live performances, meeting accomplished musicians, playing at open-mic nights, and more, all in the heart of New York City, where music icons such as Dylan, Hendrix and Velvet Underground got their start.

About St. Petersburg College:

In 1927, St. Petersburg College (then known as St. Petersburg Junior College) became Florida's first private, non-profit, two-year school of higher learning located in downtown St. Petersburg. Full accreditation followed in 1931 and in 1948 SPC became a public college. 

In June 2001, SPJC officially became St. Petersburg College when Florida's governor signed legislation making it the first community college in Florida to offer four-year degrees. On Dec. 11, 2001, the college received the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools' accreditation to offer courses leading to bachelor's degrees.

In 2002, St. Petersburg College began offering courses leading to bachelor's degrees in Education, Nursing and Technology Management. The college's commitment to its two-year curriculum, which has earned it wide recognition and annually wins it high national rankings, remains as strong as ever.

Today, SPC has ten learning sites throughout Pinellas County and recently became the first college in Florida to offer a four-year degree in Dental Hygiene. This program's offerings augment its two-year program, which has been in operation since 1963. SPC added four-year degrees in Veterinary Technology, Public Safety Administration and Orthotics and Prosthetics in 2005.

College Accreditation

St. Petersburg College is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to award associates degrees and to offer courses leading to bachelor's degrees in the following areas: Banking, Nursing, Business Administration, Orthotics & Prosthetics, Elementary/Secondary Education, Paralegal Studies. Educational Studies. Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Certification. Dental Hygiene. Public Safety Administration. Health Services Administration. Sustainability Management. International Business. Technology Management. Management & Organizational Leadership. Veterinary Technology.
SPC also offers access to junior and senior level courses for bachelors and graduate degrees at the University Partnership Center. The UPC partners with the University of South Florida, University of South Florida at St. Petersburg, Eckerd College, University of Florida, Florida State University, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, University of Central Florida, Florida International University, Florida A&M University, Saint Leo University, Florida Gulf Coast University, Florida Institute of Technology, Barry University, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University, Indiana University, and St. Petersburg College.",Arts and Music

Lyrics:
Prime Arts - Doing Me

Verse 1:
Pockets burning call me Frozen
Get a check and ""Let It Go""

Diamonds icy like December
I been playing in the snow

Used to struggle now I look up
Got a red dot on my nose
Cuz now i'm winning
And they never wanna see a hitta blow

I got 1k on my huh?
10k on my what?
I got 50k just in jewels
To let these haters know what's up

I done did it on my own
So yeah I gotta run it up
Instead of talking out your face
Go get your own and shut it up

One plus one that's me and your chick
Go do the math yeah yeah

Brand new whip 200 on it
It go fast yeah yeah

These hittas hungry for the clout
But they ain't grinding

I dropped a hit
It blew up quick
Not even trying

Got connects so my horizon getting wider
Scope out the plan and move in silence like a sniper

My own producer
My own artist
My own writer

So now they throwing shade up on me like a visor
Yeah yeah

Chorus:
Doing Me and I keep it clean
No static in between

Used to hate
Now they wanna come around and join the team

Speak to my face
Ain't no time to tote get slump just like some lean
Get slump just like some lean
(x2)

Verse 2:
Test me if you wanna
EMS just took a break

Talk a lot of game
But you still scared to catch this fade

I could pull up in a foreign with a foreign
Like a lame

VVS to see me clearly 
Guess you can't see through the shade

Diamonds wet just like a faucet
Dripping call it Fiji

Adjust that attitude with me
These haters wanna be me

Was in my room recording songs
Now look I'm on your TV

Flexing all that fake designer
Got me looking cringy

Ain't no hook up
Want a show
You better get to
Booking up

These haters looking up
They mad to
See me blow
They shooken up

I stay on top of things
To make sure
That this paper
Stays in touch

On the other line
And snatching deals
These labels
Know wussup

No more talking
Time to do it
Get it popping like pistols

Blow a couple bandz
For show and tell
Just to flex a little

Did my own 
I'm at the top
You copy
Stuck in the middle

If I aim
It's for your head
And I shoot off
Like a missile

Yeah yeah

Chorus:
Doing Me and I keep it clean
No static in between

Used to hate
Now they wanna come around and join the team

Speak to my face
Ain't no time to tote get slump just like some lean
Get slump just like some lean

People come from around the globe for the educational opportunity to study in Ghana, which is also known to many academics as the 'Gateway to Africa.' They come for the good food, friendly people, lively culture and historical sites like Kakum Park, Cape Coast Castle and Kejetia Market in Kumasi.

Many university study abroad students also enjoy studying in Ghana because English is the official language and because the country is very safe for foreigners. In the capital city Accra, musicians and dancers can learn about Ghanaian highlife music, kpanlogo (sometimes spelled panlogo) African drumming, hip-life music, and other forms of music, art and drumming of Africa. People enjoy eating indigenous African food such as fufu, banku and tilapia fish with jollof rice. Other people who travel to Ghana go to Kumasi, the former seat of the Ashanti Kingdom, where there is still an active African chief.

Ghana was formerly called the 'Gold Coast' and to this day there is active gold mining that takes place. In addition, they recently discovered oil, which may change the nation someday from a developing country into an industrialized country. Oil companies have recently started offshore oil drilling near  the Ghanaian city of Takoradi, which is the capital of the Western Region. The potential for economic growth is quite astounding, and greater than at any other time in Ghana's history. Those on summer study abroad programs and others who study in Ghana know about this growth phenomenon from studying Nigeria, which is also in West Africa though not right on the Gulf of Guinea. Since Ghana is on the Atlantic coast, it borders Togo on one side and Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) on the other.

""DEATH SQUAD ANTHEM"" LYRICS

If the mob wants blood
Then they’ll fucking get it
You started this war
Now you’ll fucking regret it

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me

Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem
The methods of peace are obsolete
So grab your guns and sing with me

If the mob wants blood
Then they’ll fucking get it

Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist
Riot, resist
Tyrants cease to exist

Divide and conquer
While they conjure
Divisive means
For the stronger
Addicted by design
To a system in decline

Arise the scourge of man
Divide the foolish
Dilute the masses
Deprived of liberty
We’ll not stand by while
Society collapses

Impatient in our rage
Force fed this disillusion
Missing a torn-out page
Suppress the revolution
All eyes on the big stage
Swept to the institutions
Complacent in our cage
Ready for the execution

21st Century Death Squad Anthem
Your life is on the line
Your obedience is their ransom
21st Century Death Squad Anthem

So grab your guns and sing with me",Arts and Music

Agnieszka Rogala about the piece:

The piece of music composed by Nikola Kołodziejczyk and my visualisation is a joint artistic action aimed at stimulating the deceased part of our soul, it is an opportunity to enter the afterlife and contact with your innermost parts of yourself, the ones that we pushed, ignored or refused to speak. Coming to the museum, watching the exhibits I try to connect with the presented characters, bringing closer their personalities and behavior … To be able to get to know them, to understand them, I imagine how they are like. However, I quickly realize that I’m selfishly looking for myself in myself. This concert is a metaphysical journey into the sphere of music and image illustrating the cosmos of our psychology.

The visualization is treated here as the fifth instrument, equally treated with string quartet. In the picture, I am looking for the deceased part of the soul and I call it to life.",Arts and Music
