His dosas—which are made from fermented rice and lentils, and stuffed with potatoes, vegetables and spicy sauces—have become an international phenomenon. Thiru grew up in Sri Lanka and learned to make South Indian recipes as a child. After he immigrated to the United States in the 90s, he made it his life's work to sell affordable, fresh and vegan dosas to NYU students, professors and other passerby's.

2,8Dt96a4FkE,New York Street Food - best street food in New York,"Consider this your essential NYC food guide. What is your favourite street food? New York Street food is great and New York food carts are world famous. There are lots of food trucks, New York street food carts and New York food markets. The variety and selection of street food in New York is amazing. One of the best ways to experience New York is through the food carts and street food. In this video we will take you on a tour of the best street food options in New York.

You can find information about all New York Food Truck Events on the following website:  We were fortunate enough to catch one of the food truck festivals. These were some of the street foods that we tried at the New York Food truck festival.
-The Mac Truck makes a variety of mac and cheese.  Mac and cheese has gained in popularity in recent years. The Mac Truck make a great variety of flavours.  
-New York pizza is an essential food to try. Where can you get the best Pizza in New York. Not sure, but the Neapolitan Express food truck located on 232 East 111th Street, New York. There are many other locations in New York. Check out the website for more.
-Lobster is not exactly a typical street food, but we were happy to encounter Cousins Maine Lobster. 

The typical New York food cart sells hot dogs, burgers and pretzels. We tried an expensive and very average $4 pretzel. I’d suggest to skip it and save your calories for something more delicious.
 
The Biryani House Cart in the New York Financial District is a highly acclaimed food cart. I love Indian food and this New York food cart is what makes New York Street food so exciting. The variety and authenticity.

The Chelsea Market is an amazing food market in a repurposed biscuit factory in the Chelsea and Meatpacking district in New York. This is one of the best food markets / best food hall that I have ever visited, with a huge variety of street food and locally produced food.  

If you love thick milkshakes and delicious hot dogs, then the Shake Shack is the place for you. We visited the original Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. This is where you will find one of the best hot dogs in New York and one of the best milkshakes in New York 

Note: I personally chose and paid for all the food in this video. None of the content is sponsored.

4,SkJaKAaRWn,New York City Food Tour : HUGE Pastrami Sandwich at Katz’s Deli and The Halal Guys!,"Join me on this delicious New York City food tour!
►Check out my NYC food guide: https://goo.gl/xubRjU
►Get a t-shirt here: https://goo.gl/3dV4uu

New York City is an incredible food city because of the diversity of the food available. On this New York City food tour we started off the day by going to one of the most famous restaurants in NYC, Katz's Delicatessen to eat pastrami. Next, we ate at a restaurants in New York City Chinatown called Spicy Village for an amazing pan of “Spicy Big Tray Chicken,” and for dinner I had chicken over rice from The Halal Guys, one of the most popular New York City street foods.

 Katz's Delicatessen - There are few places in New York City for food as famous as Katz's Delicatessen, an absolute legendary deli in the city. Although it’s well overpriced, because it’s such a heritage NYC institution, it’s one of the must eat restaurants in the city. I arrived early in the morning, hoping to beat the crowds, which I did (go for breakfast if you want to avoid lines). After a little contemplation, I decided to go for the reuben with pastrami and a half of corned beef. The corned beef was alright, but the reuben with pastrami was incredible. Total price - $48.56

 Spicy Village - Next up on this New York City food tour my wife and I walked around New York City Chinatown and eventually found our way over to a restaurant called Spicy Village (thanks to Monty for this recommendation). The one dish I mainly wanted to eat at Spicy Village was the Spicy big tray chicken, a pan of fried chicken parts and noodles in a spicy and mouth numbing broth. It was everything I had hoped for and more, and it was one of the best foods I ate in New York City! Total price - $22 - But along with the spicy big tray chicken we had an extra dish as well. 

 Times Square - One of the busiest and most recognized squares in the world is Times Square in New York City. So in the afternoon, happy and full of Spicy Village and Katz’s Deli, we walked over to Times Square to enjoy the people watching and the ridiculous amount of lights and action.

 The Halal Guys - While walking through Times Square I remembered that one of the most popular New York City street food stalls wasn’t too far away. So we walked over to The Halal Guys, and I ordered chicken over rice. The chicken over rice itself is prepared pretty plain, but the flavor in The Halal Guys is all in the white and red sauce, both of which are incredibly flavorful and delicious. It was my first time to eat at The Halal Guys, and I’m pretty happy I did. Chicken over rice - $7

It was a great first full day in New York City with some incredibly delicious food. Probably my favorite dish of the day was the spicy big tray chicken from Spicy Village, but all the food was so food.

6,1r0ocJbsY-g,Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food,"Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food

Exploring the cultural diversity exemplified throughout the vibrant street food scene in New York City.
Known as the Big Apple, New York City is home to about nine million people [≈ population of Honduras, nation] and hosts an additional 40 million visitors every year, which makes for a lot of stomachs to feed. 

Quick snacks, above all the hot dog, are as synonymous with New York as yellow cabs and skyscrapers and reflect the city's eclectic ethnic mix.

Yet few people realise that many of the city's thousands of street vendors - including Brooklyn's famed 'Falafel King' - face a daily struggle that belies the city's wealthy and glamourous image.

As the first signs of Manhattan's morning hustle and bustle surface, the city's street vendors have already been at work for many hours. Storage garages are busy with the sound of these business owners cleaning and gleaming, stocking and getting things in order for their long days ahead.

Although there are many vendors native to NYC, there is a significant number of immigrant owners - many of whom have run their businesses for decades.

Their food carts symbolise a lot more than a quick and convenient snack for the hundreds of thousands that pound the pavements of the city. They are a chance to live life on their own terms, often after escaping political turmoil or significant economic instability in their homelands. 

But the challenge is far from ideal. Obstacles to a successful business range from finding the perfect selling spot - in spite of an unspoken brotherhood between the vendors that can and has led to rivalries - and adhering to legislation surrounding health and safety, to liquidity and endless working hours. 

On the other side of the river, street vendors in Brooklyn and Queens face an even tougher uphill battle. Catering to a rougher demographic, and often without the means - both financial and otherwise - food cart owners, many of whom are new to the US, tend to find themselves operating illegally and, at times, even dangerously. 

Follow this episode of Street Food to get a glimpse into the good, the bad and the delicious of New York's vendors.

13,MOALD-7vq,New York Street Food - INDIAN MASALA DOSA and Young Coconut Water,"Dosa is a kind of pancake made from a fermented batter. Its main ingredients are rice and urad beans. Dosa is part and parcel of the South Indian diet and popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, Dosa is served hot along with Sambar and Chutney. It can be consumed with Idli podi as well.

The masala dosa is made by stuffing a dosa with a lightly cooked filling of potatoes, fried onions and spices. The dosa is wrapped around an onion and potato curry or masala. 

Dosa can be stuffed with fillings of vegetables and sauces to make a quick meal. They are typically served with a vegetarian side dish which varies according to regional and personal preferences. 

Common side items are:
- Sambar
- Wet chutney: examples include coconut chutney (a semisolid paste made up of coconut, dal (lentils), green chilli and mint or coriander)
- Dry chutney (Idli podi or molagapodi): a powder of spices and sometimes desiccated coconut
- Indian pickles",Food

18,IugcIAAZJ2M,The Iconic Dollar Pizza Slice of NYC - Street Food Icons,"Eli and Oren Halali, the two brothers who founded 2 Bros Pizza, sell slices for a buck. They're known for getting their patrons in and out of the store within ten seconds, and for selling hundreds of pies a day. And they're certainly not the only people in the dollar-slice game in New York City. 

Ever since the Great Recession in 2008, dollar-slice spots started popping up all over Manhattan because people were in desperate need of a quick and cheap food option. Now there are more than 80 dollar-slice spots on the streets of New York. People gravitate to dollar slice because it's quick, easy, cheap, filling—and the slices themselves are pretty damn good considering the price. 

But, according to pizza historian Scott Wiener, dollar slices may be on the way out...so get them while you can!

►T-shirts: 

On Day 30 of my Round The World Trip for Food my wife and I decided to make a food trek to Brooklyn to eat one of the best pizzas in New York City. The pizza restaurant: Di Fara Pizza. We then went to Gloria’s Caribbean Cuisine to eat some fantastic Trinidad cuisine. It was another good day of food in New York City.

 Di Fara Pizza - When you do any kind of searching for the best pizza in New York City, it won’t take you long to find Di Fara Pizza, a family run restaurant in Brooklyn known for their incredible pizza. Also, when I went to NYC, many of you recommended that I needed to try Di Fara, so I decided that a pilgrimage was  must. I arrived before they opened for lunch, and was first in line. I was a little torn as what to order, but finally just went with the classic round pie with half pepperoni and half cheese. The pizza took about 15 minutes to make and it came out of the oven hot and fresh. As soon as it came out, he chopped on some fresh basil. That first slice of pizza I had was one of the best pieces of pizza I’ve ever had. Everything tasted so pure and so balanced. The crust was right, the sauce and cheese were perfect. All the ingredients they use to make their pizza at Di Fara are from Italy, and so that’s part of the reason their pizza is so expensive. Is it the best pizza in New York City? I’m not really qualified to answer this as I haven’t been to all the famous pizza places in NYC. But what I can say is that Di Fara pizza is mind-blowingly good. Pizza price - $31

 Gloria’s Caribbean Cuisine - After finishing the pizza we moved on to Gloria’s Caribbean Cuisine, a restaurant in Crown Height known for serving Caribbean food and especially mostly Trinidadian food. I decided to order the curry chicken meal while my wife ordered the curry fish meal. Both of the meals were huge and came with sides, rice, and vegetables. The curry chicken and curry fish were both excellent, full of spice flavor. This was my first time to have Trinidadian food, and it’s made me want to go to Trinidad immediately. For excellent Caribbean food in New York City, Gloria’s Caribbean Cuisine is a friendly restaurant. Curry chicken meal - $11, Curry fish meal - $13.

And that was basically it for the day. Ying wasn’t feeling too well, so we headed back to our hotel and rested. It was another great day of food in New York City!

►Subscribe to my channel: 
►Check out my NYC food guide: 

Shake Shack is one of the most famous NYC fast food burger chains, and I didn’t want to leave NYC without trying it. We then went to church and then on to eat Ethiopian food!

 Stumptown Coffee Roasters - I’m a big fan of coffee, and since it wasn’t too far away from where we were staying, we started off the day by going to Stumptown Coffee Roasters. I ordered an Americano which was wonderful, and a cold brew to go. Americano - $3.25
Cold brew - $4.50

 Flatiron Building / Madison Square Park - While drinking my coffee, we were just enjoying New York City walking around leisurely. We had a great view of the famous Flatiron building, and then we continued on walking around Madison Square Park. 

 Shake Shack at Madison Square Park - I wasn’t actually planning to eat at Shake Shack today, but since we happen to be at Madison Square Park and since it was just a little while before they opened for the day, I decided it would be the perfect opportunity to try Shake Shack for the first time. I ordered the double Shack burger, which came with all the toppings. I’ll let you watch the full video for a full review of the burger and Shake Shack, but what stood out to me was the beef and the bun, which were about as excellent as fast food can get for me. Full Shake Shack review within the video. Double Shack Burger - $8.09, Chicken Shack - $6.29, Fries - $2.99

 Hillsong Church NYC - After eating Shake Shack, since it was Sunday, we walked over to Hillsong Church NYC to attend the service. It was huge!

 Meske Ethiopian Restaurant - After church we headed to Meske Ethiopian Restaurant, which is one of Sarah’s favorite Ethiopian restaurants in NYC. It was so good to hang out with Sarah and to eat Ethiopian food — it had been way too long! We ordered the special tibs, doro wat, and a variety of vegetarian dishes. Total price - about $90

 Luke's Lobster - Finally for dinner, since it was our final day in NYC, I didn’t want to leave without trying lobster roll. I wasn’t able to go to the exact location I had wanted to go, but I there was a Luke’s Lobster not too far from where I was staying. Lobster roll - $18.51 - It tasted food, but it was pretty expensive.

29,8GdYJIanFz4,Spicy Cumin Lamb Noodles at Xi'an Famous Foods & Flushing New York City Chinese Food Tour!,"Xi'an Famous Foods serves amazing food in Flushing, Queens, NYC!
►Subscribe to my channel: 
►Check out my NYC food guide: 
►T-shirts: 

On Day 31 of our Round The World Trip with Star Alliance we decided to take a New York City food tour to Flushing. The main thing I wanted to eat was at the famous Xi'an Famous Foods for their spicy cumin lamb noodles. But we also enjoyed some incredible dumplings and a rack of cumin coated lamb. It was incredible.

 Journey to Flushing, Queens - The first part of the day was to take the train from Manhattan out to Queens, and more specifically to Flushing. It takes a while, but it’s pretty straightforward to get there by public transportation.

 Xi'an Famous Foods - Located in the basement of the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing, Queens, Xi'an Famous Foods is a well known Chinese food restaurant with a number of branches throughout New York City. Xi'an Famous Foods was one of the top places I wanted to eat in NYC. At the bottom of the shopping center there’s a nice food court, and it really does feel like you transport yourself from NYC to China. I ordered the spicy cumin lamb noodles and an extra side of spicy cucumber salad. The spicy cumin lamb, with hand pulled noodles, was absolutely incredible - one of the best food dishes I ate in all of New York. And the spicy cucumber salad also went superbly with the noodles. The chili oil and the cumin was just absolutely superb. Total price - $15.51

 Tianjin Dumpling House - Next up in the same Golden Shopping Mall, I walked over to Tianjin Dumpling House and I ordered their classic pork dumplings. Although you could choose from a range of many different types of dumplings. Overall, they were pretty good and I liked how they were cooked fresh so they were piping hot. Pork dumplings - $5

 White Bear - For won ton lovers in New York City, taking a trip to White Bear in Flushing, Queens, is one of the food lovers pilgrimages. So after the spicy cumin lamb noodles we walked over to white bear. The won tons came with hot chili oil on top and an assortment of mostly pickled mustard greens. Although the chili wasn’t spicy, but was extremely fragrant and tasted amazing. It was another delicious places of dumplings in Flushing. Wonton with hot sauce - $5.50

 Fu Run Restaurant - Finally, our last Chinese food meal in Flushing, we decided to sit down at a restaurant called Fu Run. Along with hot and sour soup and fries string beans, what I really wanted to try at Fu Run Restaurant were the Muslim lamb chops, fried and seasoned with an abundance of garlic and cumin. They were absolutely awesome, fall apart tender lamb, crispy on the edges and just coated in toasted crispy cumin seeds. Although some people say the quality of the Muslim Chinese lamb chops at Fu Run has gone down, I thought they were still absolutely superb. Though I’d like to try the same dish from other restaurants in Flushing, next time I’m in Queens. Total price - $49.50

 Times Square station - Central Park - After coming back from our food trip to Flushing, Queens, we then took a walk around Central Park, just enjoying New York City.

 Fresh&Co - For dinner, since I think I had eaten my share of meat for the day, I decided to go vegetarian and had a salad. Although it was too expensive, it was pretty good. Gaucho salad - $9.95

After being dissatisfied with the falafel and shawarma offerings in New York, Freddy took matters into his own hands by starting King of Falafel & Shawarma in 2002. Since then, his enterprise has grown, with a truck in Astoria, a cart in Midtown, and a newly opened restaurant in Queens. 

They also serve chicken over rice, kebabs, meatballs, and other Palestinian specialties. As Freddy would say, ""Yeah Baby!""

41,OxM91xQsmgg,New York City Street Food - Artisan Pizza Margherita Pepperoni,"Pizza is a flatbread generally topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It is commonly topped with a selection of meats, vegetables and condiments. Common toppings for pizza in the United States include ground beef, mushrooms, onions, pepperoni, pineapple, garlic, chicken and sausage.

A popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen as ""Pizza Margherita.""",Food

44,-AJnc6_8,New York City Street Food - Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich,"Fedoroff’s South Philly Cheesesteaks 

A cheesesteak, also known as a Philadelphia cheesesteak, Philly cheesesteak, cheesesteak sandwich, cheese steak, or steak and cheese, is a sandwich made from thinly sliced pieces of beefsteak and melted cheese in a long hoagie roll. A popular regional fast food, it has its roots in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

The meat traditionally used is thinly sliced rib-eye or top round, although other cuts of beef are also used. On a lightly oiled griddle at medium temperature, the steak slices are quickly browned and then scrambled into smaller pieces with a flat spatula. Slices of cheese are then placed over the meat, letting it melt, and then the roll is placed on top of the cheese. The mixture is then scooped up with a spatula and pressed into the roll, which is then cut in half.

Common additions include sautéed onions, peppers, mushrooms, mayonnaise, hot sauce, salt, pepper, and ketchup.

American cheese, Cheez Whiz, and provolone are the most commonly used cheeses or cheese products put on to the Philly cheesesteak. White American cheese along with provolone cheese are the favorites due to the mild flavor and medium consistency of American cheese.

The Halal Guys (commonly known as Chicken and Rice, 53rd and 6th, or Platters) is a halal gyros food cart on the south-east corner of 53rd Street and 6th Avenue in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. The franchise also has a cart on the south-west corner of the same intersection during weekdays from 7pm-4am and weekends until 5am. New locations are being added throughout New York, including a storefront on 14th St and 2nd Ave.

The cart is most recognized by its primary dish which is a platter of chicken and/or gyro meat with rice while it also serves a chicken and/or gyro wrap. The cart opens from  pm, and does not close until 4 am.

History
The Halal Guys was founded in 1990 by Mohamed Abouelenein, from Egypt,[5] as a cart located on 53rd and 6th. The cart began as a hot dog vendor, however Abouelenein believed that the hot dog was not a satisfying meal and switched to the current menu of chicken, gyro meat, rice, and pita in 1992.

The cart has caused a decline in the popularity of hot dog vendors in New York City and has influenced many imitation carts. A cart known as New York's Best Halal Food also located on 53rd and 6th next on the SW corner, weekdays until 7pm. It is unknown which cart was located at the intersection first. 'New York's Best Halal Food' also has a strong following and long line of lunchtime patrons. They wear similar attire (bright yellow shirts) and serve the same type of food though the texture, taste, and freshness is slightly different.

Locations
The main cart is located on 53rd and 6th Ave during weekday evenings (7pm-4am) and weekends, across from the Hilton Hotel.

A second cart is located across the street from the original cart, on the south-east corner of 6th Avenue and 53rd Street and is open both during the daytime and at night.

A third cart exists on the south-west corner of 53rd Street and 7th Avenue, and begins serving food at lunch time.

In November 2013, The Halal Guys announced its intentions to open a restaurant located on 14th St. and 2nd Ave. according to general manager Hesham Hegazy.

Menu
The cart serves platters and sandwiches. The platter includes meat (chicken, gyro lamb or both), rice, iceberg lettuce (or, instead, extra rice), and slices of pita bread. The sandwich serves the same ingredients wrap in pita bread instead. The third, infrequently ordered, menu option is a platter that does not include rice.

White sauce
The Halal Guys serve a unique white condiment which patrons cite as a favorite. Operators of the stand maintain it is not mayonnaise, but have admitted that it may contain mayonnaise in some part as well as yogurt.",Food

Where to eat Halal food in New York City. Best Halal Food in New York City. NYC Halal Street Food Tour. Best Chicken over rice in NYC.

In this video, we will take you on a tour of some of the best Halal food in NYC. Five carts and trucks across Manhattan and Queens. 

Halal food is probably the most popular street food in New York City. Halal food carts are everywhere throughout New York City in all five boroughs. One cart is famous worldwide and we will show you how it stacks up among the rest. 

But, we couldn't tackle all of this food by ourselves. So, we invited a special guest to eat with us. He has eaten some of the WORST rated food in NYC, so we wanted to show him some of the BEST. 

Subscribe to Tal aka The Traveling Clatt below: 



Check out his video on our epic night of Halal cart feasting:





Here are all of the carts and trucks we visited: 

1. Royal Grill Halal
W 44 St between 6th and 7th Avenue
New York, NY 10036

The Royal Grill Halal cart won the Vendy Cup at the 2018 Vendy Awards honoring the best street food vendors in NYC. They are run by a Bangladeshi family and their signature dish is Chicken Tikka Masala. This isn’t like the creamy version most of us are used We ordered that with just a little green sauce and mango pickle/chutney (ASK for it!)


2. Kwik Meal
100 W 45 St (between 6th and 7th Avenue)
New York, NY 10036

Kwik Meal has high-end restaurant pedigree, as the owner used to work at the Russian Tea Room. The ingredients here are high quality and well worth spending a little extra on. We ordered the lamb over rice, made with real slices of lamb, no mystery meat here!


3. The Halal Guys
W 53 St and 6 Ave
New York, NY 10019

The Halal Guys is one of the most iconic spots in NYC. It is also now a worldwide chain with locations in the Philippines, Indonesia, Canada and all over the United States. They were the originators of halal street food as we know it, or at least the ones who made it really popular. We ordered a chicken over rice here with the white sauce and hot sauce.

4. King of Falafel and Shawarma
30-16 Ditmars Blvd
Astoria, NY 11105

The King of Falafel & Shawarma is another legendary NYC street food icon. This Palestinian vendor won the Vendy Cup back in 2010 at the Vendy Awards. They are also one of the few trucks where you can order a proper stacked shawarma off the spit. Their falafel here is delicious and the shawarma very well-seasoned. Here, we ordered a beef and lamb shawarma over rice with tahini and hot sauce.

5. Sammy's Halal Food
73 St & Broadway
Jackson Heights, NY 11372

Our final stop was Sammy's Halal Food in Jackson Heights, Queens. This is a longtime favorite of ours and have been eating it for many years. They are also Vendy Award winners, having won the Vendy Cup in 2006. Here, we ordered a chicken over rice with white sauce, hot sauce and green sauce (you have to ASK them for this one, they don't offer it right away!)

ABOUT FOOD AND FOOTPRINTS:

We are Greg and Jumi, hailing from opposite ends of the globe. Greg is a native New Yorker who was born and raised in Queens NYC and Jumi grew up in the beautiful islands of the Visayas region of the Philippines. 

How did we meet? One of us messaged the other on Instagram (before sliding in DM's was even possible through the app!) and we met just after Hurricane Sandy hit NYC in October 2012. Although we grew up in two very different worlds, we bonded over a love of experiences over material things, delicious food and exploration.

We have visited 15+ countries together since December 2014 exploring beaches, ancient temples, bustling streets and ruins. Along the way, we get adrenaline flowing whether paragliding, ziplining, or jetskiing.

To fuel up for our adventures (and everyday life), we eat lots of local food wherever we are. Street food, carts, trucks, hidden gems and family-run sit-downs are our mainstays. We don't cook, but prefer to spend our money on experiences and we treat food as one. Hey, we gotta eat regardless, right? May as well enjoy it and support good businesses while we're at it! 

All of this is done while we work full-time at our day jobs. How do we do it? Follow along our journeys and you will learn more. Welcome to our lifestyle!",Food

This was a good first event for Halal Food Fest and something that we hope would continue to grow in Long Island and New York City. We were invited by Hal & Al to cover the Halal Food Fest as Press and showcase some of the food being served by various halal food vendors.

The Only vendors that denied to be reviewed were “ PARI PURI “ and “Holy Cow “ the rest you will see covered here. The food was quite delicious, it was exciting to experience such diverse food at same day :) None of the vendors expected this many people to attend, some vendors actually ran out of food. Shows that there is a huge need for such events.

58,BIe4d7kNf,New York City Street Food - Lobster Roll,"Plump and juicy Maine lobster meat tossed with a touch of homemade mayo piled on to a toasted buttery split-top bun and topped with paprika and scallions. Served by Red Hook Lobster Pound.

A traditional lobster roll is a sandwich filled with lobster meat soaked in butter and served on a steamed hot dog bun or similar roll, so that the opening is on the top rather than on the side. There are variations of this sandwich made in other parts of New England, which may contain diced celery or scallion, and mayonnaise. The sandwich may also contain lettuce, lemon juice, salt and black pepper. Traditional New England restaurants serve lobster rolls with potato chips or french fries on the side. For those residing in Connecticut, a lobster roll served warm is simply called a ""lobster roll"" while the lobster roll served cold as it is throughout the rest of the northeast region and the world is called a ""lobster salad roll"". 

Lobster rolls in the U.S. are associated with the state of Maine, but are also commonly available at seafood restaurants in the other New England states and on Eastern Long Island, where lobster fishing is common. Lobster rolls prepared in Maine generally have several common characteristics: first, the roll itself is a ""New England"" or ""Frankfurter"" roll that is baked slightly differently from a standard hot dog roll, so the sides are flat and can be buttered on the outside and lightly grilled or toasted, and is split on the top instead of the side; second, the lobster meat in the roll is usually served cold, rather than warm or hot; third, there can be a very light spread of mayonnaise inside the bun or tossed with the meat before filling the roll, though usually do not have any other ingredients typical of the ""lobster salad"" variation in other parts of New England. The lobster meat is usually knuckle, claw, and tail meat chunks, with 4oz of meat (""1/4 pound"") the common advertised serving size.",Food

Cayenne pepper hot sauce and melted butter or margarine are the basis of the sauce, which may be mild, medium, or hot. Typically, the wings are deep-fried in oil (although they are sometimes grilled or baked) until they are well browned. They are then drained, mixed with sauce, and shaken to coat the wings, completely covering them in the sauce.

ABOUT FOOD AND FOOTPRINTS:

We are Greg and Jumi, hailing from opposite ends of the globe. Greg is a native New Yorker who was born and raised in Queens NYC and Jumi grew up in the beautiful islands of the Visayas region of the Philippines. 

How did we meet? One of us messaged the other on Instagram (before sliding in DM's was even possible through the app!) and we met just after Hurricane Sandy hit NYC in October 2012. Although we grew up in two very different worlds, we bonded over a love of experiences over material things, delicious food and exploration.

We have visited 15+ countries together since December 2014 exploring beaches, ancient temples, bustling streets and ruins. Along the way, we get adrenaline flowing whether paragliding, ziplining, or jetskiing.

To fuel up for our adventures (and everyday life), we eat lots of local food wherever we are. Street food, carts, trucks, hidden gems and family-run sit-downs are our mainstays. We don't cook, but prefer to spend our money on experiences and we treat food as one. Hey, we gotta eat regardless, right? May as well enjoy it and support good businesses while we're at it! 

All of this is done while we work full-time at our day jobs. How do we do it? Follow along our journeys and you will learn more. Welcome to our lifestyle!",Food

73,R3PetI0LcQI,New York City Street Food - Chamoyada Ice Dessert,"Chamoyada is a sweet and spicy type of shaved ice, or raspado, prepared with chamoy. It is a part of Mexican cuisine, and is also common in regions of the United States with significant Mexican-American populations. The drink is usually sweetened with mangoes or apricots. It is essentially a combination of chamoy sauce, shaved ice, chili powder, and fruit chunks. In certain variations, a whole fruit popsicle, or paleta, is added to the drink and mixed with the shaved ice. The drinking straws served with chamoyadas also often have tamarind candy on the outside.

Chamoyadas do not contain any dairy products. The different flavors of chamoyadas can include fruits like mango, lemon, guava, tamarind, pineapple and strawberry.

How long would you last as a street food vendor?

Evelia’s team gets started every night around 8pm, working through until 4am where she rolls out her cart and sells hundreds of her famous tamales. She does this every day, rain or shine, winter and summer. 

She can’t afford to take a break. 

Why?

Because she has to buy her vendor’s permit on the black market for $18,000 instead of the real cost of $200.

Watch this video to understand a day in the life of an NYC street vendor, and why vending permits are so expensive.

77,FdVXDVPUFzM,New York City Street Food - Mofongo with Fried Pork Chicharrón,"Mofongo is an Afro- Puerto Rican dish with fried plantains as its main ingredient. Plantains are picked green and mashed with salt and water in a wooden pilón, a kitchen device also known as mortar and pestle. The object is to produce a tight ball of mashed plantains that would absorb the attending condiments and have either pork cracklings (Chicharrón) or bits of bacon inside. Most dressings and mixtures include broth, garlic, and olive oil. It is traditionally served with fried meat and chicken broth soup. Particular flavors result from variations that include vegetables, chicken, shrimp, beef, or octopus packed inside or around the plantain orb.

Mofongo evolved from fufu using African method with Spanish and Taíno ingredients. Plantains are most often used, but other starchy roots native to the island used by Taínos can also be used. Puerto Ricans have an obsession with fried food known collectively as cuchifrito in New York City and Kiosks in Puerto Rico. The usage of Spanish ingredients such as pork, garlic, broth, and olive oil together is heavily used in Puerto Rican cuisine. Staple dishes such as arroz con gandules, alcapurria, pasteles, habichuelas, recaíto, arroz junto and many other dishes all include garlic, pork, olive oil, and broth. The method of frying comes from the African side and is heavily used more than anyplace in the Caribbean. Broth is often made with chicken and sofrito. Sofrito is made with Spanish and Taíno fruits, vegetables, and herbs.

In Cuba, Mofongo is called Machuquillo ""por la acción de machucar el plátano en el mortero"" (because of the task of mashing the plantains in the mortar). The plantains are not fried but boiled. Machuquillo is often garnished with parsley and served with roasted pork or chicken.
During the 1960s many Dominicans who feared the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo fled to Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo caught on quickly with Dominicans living in Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo has become a flagship food for many Dominican restaurant adding their own flavors such as queso frito (fried cheese) to mofongo, mashed with no broth and sometimes olive oil is replace with butter. The plantains in making traditional mofongo are not always fried, they are sometimes boiled, shaped into a ball and stuffed with meat. During the 1960s mofongo started to appear in Dominican cookbook's. Mofongo stuffed with shrimp (camaron in Spanish) is called camarofongo.",Food

On Day 34 of our Round The World Trip for food we flew from New York City to Hong Kong for the final destination of our trip. We flew on United Airlines again, and it was a long direct flight straight to Hong Kong!

 Hot dog - Something I hadn’t eaten in New York City so far was a hot dog, which is one of the most iconic foods in all of New York City. So although it wasn’t the ideal place to eat a hot dog and the price was expensive, I just decided to go for it. It was a little bland, but that’s the classic New York City street food.

 United Airlines from Newark Liberty Airport to Hong Kong on business class - We got all checked into our flight successfully and then boarded the airplane en-route to Hong Kong. For our first meal on the flight I had short rib, which was one of the best pieces of meat I’ve ever had on any airplane flight ever.

 Arrival to Hong Kong - I had an excellent flight with United Airlines. The food and service for business class were both fantastic. The boneless short rib was the highlight of the flight. Since Ying wasn’t feeling very good, we decided to just take a taxi directly to our hotel in Hong Kong.

 JW Marriott Hong Kong - We got all checked into the JW Marriott in Hong Kong, our room was really nice, and we had a pretty decent view as well. Since it was already getting late and both Ying and I were extremely tired, we called it a day there. 

But get ready for the full out Hong Kong food tour on the next video!

87,VsvWGKOgtbg,BEST Late Night TACOS AL PASTOR in NEW YORK | Mexican Street Food NYC,"The best tacos al pastor in NYC can be found late night on the streets of Jackson Heights, Queens. Yes, the term “best” isn’t one to be thrown around loosely, but we truly believe these are the best NYC has to offer. Watch the video to see for yourself why. 

We have been coming to this cart on Roosevelt Avenue and Junction Boulevard for about a year and a half now and are hooked! We gained an even greater respect for their craft after visiting Mexico City earlier this year, which has spinning trompos of al pastor on nearly every block at times. 


We post about this cart often on Instagram and we devoted an entire blog post to it:





Where are your favorite spots for al pastor? Let us know in the comments below!

ABOUT FOOD AND FOOTPRINTS:

We are Greg and Jumi, hailing from opposite ends of the globe. Greg is a native New Yorker who was born and raised in Queens NYC and Jumi grew up in the beautiful islands of the Visayas region of the Philippines. 

How did we meet? One of us messaged the other on Instagram (before sliding in DM's was even possible through the app!) and we met just after Hurricane Sandy hit NYC in October 2012. Although we grew up in two very different worlds, we bonded over a love of experiences over material things, delicious food and exploration.

We have visited 15+ countries together since December 2014 exploring beaches, ancient temples, bustling streets and ruins. Along the way, we get adrenaline flowing whether paragliding, ziplining, or jetskiing.

To fuel up for our adventures (and everyday life), we eat lots of local food wherever we are. Street food, carts, trucks, hidden gems and family-run sit-downs are our mainstays. We don't cook, but prefer to spend our money on experiences and we treat food as one. Hey, we gotta eat regardless, right? May as well enjoy it and support good businesses while we're at it! 

All of this is done while we work full-time at our day jobs. How do we do it? Follow along our journeys and you will learn more. Welcome to our lifestyle!",Food

Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We went for a full on Mexican street food tour in Puebla, Mexico, and discovered the most incredible FAST cutting sandwich lady, with the fastest knife cutting skills, kind of like the Super Human Sandwich Fruit Ninja of Mexico, along with amazing tacos with spicy salsa and delicious mole poblano! ALL of the Best Mexican Street Food!

In this street food tour vlog, we venture outside of Mexico city to Puebla, to eat the best street food in Mexico and taste the world famous Mole sauce over top of juicy chicken. It was spicy, full of chili, and so delicious.

The Best Street Food we found, was definitely the cemita sandwich from Puebla, which was made by the most amazing woman, the Sandwich Ninja of Mexico! The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well. The way her hands worked was amazing to watch, and this was just one of the street foods we had in Puebla, Mexico! The Chicken sandwich was so plump and delicious

We started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico city, eating a ton of delicious street food in Part 1 and 2 here:




After this, we spent a day on a street food adventure to go to Puebla, all in search of the famous Mole poblano, but we found so much more.  The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. 

After those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more!

After this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!

After exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. 

After eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.

Here are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:

1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square
2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market
3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market
4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros
5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla

94,OOJl8lwQ6D,Brooklyn’s Fresh Take on Taiwanese Street Food || Eat Seeker: Win Son,"There’s more to a dish than what’s served on a plate. A chef’s food can act as a voice to share a story, whether that be a tale of identity crisis or a struggle to find a place in an established cuisine. Eat Seeker delves deeper into the meaning behind the dishes that represent the chef and looks at what motivates their cuisine.

Over the last few years, Taiwanese food has slowly been getting a little more recognition across the city of New York. At the beloved Taiwanese spot, Win Son, co-owners Trigg Brown and Josh Ku have worked incredibly hard to build an association with the language they use on their menu. Together they have crafted a menu that highlights Taiwanese mainstays like the o-a jian (oyster omelette), fly’s head, and danzi noodles at their Brooklyn restaurant. Their hope is that small changes like using the Taiwanese dish names on the menu can help promote Taiwanese cultural and culinary identity in the city.

The street food has been part of American’s dining habits since the late 17th century, where vendors mirror the food and tradition of their families and more often than not countries of origin. It is a way for immigrants to keep their culture and traditions alive, while making a living. However, there had been a constant disagreement with the city council and governing institutions, as the street vending has been seen as a segregated class  That has resulted in consistently produced restrictive regulations as well as complaints from businesses and the public.",Food

105,lXgDxohbOI,New York City Street Food - Italian Tramezzini Sandwiches,"POMODORO & MOZZARELLA DI BUFALA Tramezzini:
organic tomatoes, italian buffalo mozzarella, locally grown basil

Made by Tramezzini NYC.

The tramezzino is a usually triangular sandwich constructed from two slices of soft white bread with the crusts removed. Tramezzini are popular and inexpensive snack sandwiches available at many Italian bars throughout the day. Popular fillings include tuna and olive and prosciutto, but many other fillings can be used.

The origin of the tramezzino can be found in the Caffè Mulassano di Piazza Castello in Turin where it was devised in 1925 as an alternative to English tea sandwiches. Today the bar offers 40 varieties of tramezzini.
 
The word tramezzino was invented by Gabriele D'Annunzio as a replacement for the English word ""sandwich"", being easier to pronounce and a completely Italian term (albeit a neologism). ""Tramezzino"" sounds like ""in-between"", with the addition of the diminutive suffix ""-ino"".",Food

107,KCUqrPyQ45Q,"LONDON STREET FOOD, BURGERS, SPANISH OMELETTE, OYSTERS, WRAPS, CAKES","LONDON STREET FOOD, BURGERS, SPANISH OMELETTE, OYSTERS, WRAPS, CAKES, Street food is ready-to-eat food or drink sold by a hawker, or vendor, in a street or other public place, such as at a market or fair. It is often sold from a portable food booth,[1] food cart, or food truck and meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but many have spread beyond their region of origin. Most street foods are classed as both finger food and fast food, and are cheaper on average than restaurant meals. According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization, 2.5 billion people eat street food every day.[2]

Today, people may purchase street food for a number of reasons, such as convenience, to get flavourful food for a reasonable price in a sociable setting, to try ethnic cuisines, or for nostalgia.  Street food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly between regions and cultures.[29] For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being ""fresh and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area"" and ""draw[ing] heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime"", while street food of Thailand is ""fiery"" and ""pungent with shrimp paste ... and fish sauce."" New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, however, New York street food also includes everything from ""spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles""[30]


Grilled bread with jam served with sweetened milk in Bangkok
Street food in Thailand offers various selection of ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks sold by hawkers or vendors at food stalls or food carts on the street side. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best place for street food.[31][32] Popular street offerings includes pad thai (stir fried rice noodle), som tam (green papaya salad), sour tom yum soup, various selection of Thai curries, to sticky rice mango

Indonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese, and Dutch influences.[33] Indonesian street food often tastes rather strong and spicy. A lot of street food in Indonesia are fried, such as local gorengan (fritters), also nasi goreng and ayam goreng, while bakso meatball soup, skewered chicken satay and gado-gado vegetable salad served in peanut sauce are also popular.[34]

Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every region has its own specialties to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes are Vada Pav, Cholle Bhature, Parathas, Rolls, Bhel Puri, Sev Puri, Gol Gappa, Aloo tikki, Kebabs, Tandoori chicken, Samosa, Bread omelette, Pav bhaji and Pakora. In India, street food is popularly known as nukkadwala food. There are several restaurants and QSRs in India that have also taken their inspiration from the vibrant street food of India.[35]


Street food in Hyderabad, Telangana, India
In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of ""plate lunch"" (rice, macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the bento of the Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers.[36] In Denmark, sausage wagons allow passersby to purchase sausages and hot dogs.

In Egypt, a food sold commonly on the street is ful, a slow-cooked fava bean dish.[37]

Mexican street food is known as ""antojitos"" (translated as ""little cravings"") which include several varieties of tacos, such as tacos al pastor, huaraches and other maize based foods.  Small fried fish were a street food in ancient Greece;[4] however, Theophrastus held the custom of street food in low regard.[5] Evidence of a large number of street food vendors was discovered during the excavation of Pompeii.[6] Street food was widely consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes did not have ovens or hearths.[7] Here, chickpea soup[8] with bread and grain paste[9] were common meals. In ancient China, street food generally catered to the poor, however, wealthy residents would send servants to buy street food and bring it back for them to eat in their homes.[7]

A traveling Florentine reported in the late 14th century that in Cairo, people brought picnic cloths made of rawhide to spread on the streets and sit on while they ate their meals of lamb kebabs, rice, and fritters that they had purchased from street vendors.[10] In Renaissance Turkey, many crossroads had vendors selling ""fragrant bites of hot meat"", including chicken and lamb that had been spit-roasted.[11] In 1502, Ottoman Turkey became the first country to legislate and standardize street food.[12]",Food

ABOUT FOOD AND FOOTPRINTS:

We are Greg and Jumi, hailing from opposite ends of the globe. Greg is a native New Yorker who was born and raised in Queens NYC and Jumi grew up in the beautiful islands of the Visayas region of the Philippines. 

How did we meet? One of us messaged the other on Instagram (before sliding in DM's was even possible through the app!) and we met just after Hurricane Sandy hit NYC in October 2012. Although we grew up in two very different worlds, we bonded over a love of experiences over material things, delicious food and exploration.

We have visited 15+ countries together since December 2014 exploring beaches, ancient temples, bustling streets and ruins. Along the way, we get adrenaline flowing whether paragliding, ziplining, or jetskiing.

To fuel up for our adventures (and everyday life), we eat lots of local food wherever we are. Street food, carts, trucks, hidden gems and family-run sit-downs are our mainstays. We don't cook, but prefer to spend our money on experiences and we treat food as one. Hey, we gotta eat regardless, right? May as well enjoy it and support good businesses while we're at it! 

All of this is done while we work full-time at our day jobs. How do we do it? Follow along our journeys and you will learn more. Welcome to our lifestyle!

132,1EOrF1jd9CU,Why the Jamaican Beef Patty Is a NYC Icon | Food Grails,"Welcome to Food Grails, a new First We Feast travel series hosted by Miss Info. As a music journalist, she's travelled the world and seen the power of artists who rep for their hometown sound. Now, she wants to discover how foods define a city’s flavor—from Atlanta's lemon-pepper wings, to NYC's beef patties. These are America’s food grails.

In episode 2, Miss Info investigates how the Jamaican beef patty became a NYC icon. As the flaky meat turnover has infiltrated all aspects of city life—found in mom-and-pop bakeries, bodegas, pizza shops, and even street carts—the patty itself has inspired fierce debate. Because if you think a patty is a patty is a patty...well, you're dead wrong. From heated conversations with DJ Clark Kent, to philosophical musings in the back of a Rolls Royce with Upscale Vandal, here are what New Yorkers really have to say about the beef patty.

136,9dH1m2GFF4,"WHAT TO EAT IN FLUSHING, Queens Chinatown","Check out our food guide to New York's BETTER Chinatown in Flushing, Queens. Street food, food courts, and supermarkets. All delicious!

Be sure to check out Jon's channel at Here Be Barr: 
And his Flushing video is here: 

Here's what we ate:
1. () Peking Duck Bun, $1.25. Go in the Happy Food building on the corner of 40th and Main. About 10 steps in on your left, just say ""Peking Duck Bun"" and hold up a few fingers to tell them how many you want.

2. () Pork Bun, 4 for $2. This vendor is directly in front of the Happy Food building, on Main. Holding up 1 finger here will give you one order of 4. I don't think you can get less than four but honestly, the more the better. In Mandarin, these are ""Bao Dzuh Jo-Ru""

3. () Egg, Chive, and Glass Noodle Pocket ($1.25) and Pan Seared Pork and Chive Bun ($1.25). These are both in the street level takeout window in front of Golden Mall, which is down main street just past the library on the opposite side of the street from the library.

4. () Pineapple Bun, $1.25. New Flushing Bakery is on the NW corner of Main and Roosevelt. It basically has its own subway entrance ()

5. () J-Mart is up the escalator inside New World Mall. We entered from Main Street at 40th. If you're going to buy some fruit or produce, this is the place. It's packed and chaotic, but the prices are phenomenal.

6. () Lamb Noodle Soup, Lanzhou Noodle in New World Mall's food court ($8.00). The noodles are fresh and delicious. Add some spice and flavor which is available for free at the counter where you order.

7. () Unknown dumplings, $5.50. So I had heard Lanzhou served this giant dumpling with 5 smaller dumplings inside of it. On the menu, it just says, ""dumpling,"" so that's what I ordered. But i got these instead. They were ok.

8. () Dry Pot, $16. This is from Laoma Mala Tang in the New World Mall food court. You pick your ingredients and then pay based on weight. It's spicier than you think, so I suggest knocking your spice preference down a notch here.

9. () Tao Pancake ($3.75). This is from Tao Rice Rolls in the New World Mall Food Court. It's decently good.

We definitely need to go back to try White Bear, Xiao Long Bao, and a few other places we didn't have time to visit on this trip. Make sure you're subscribed so you can see our review of those places as well.

Check out more of First We Feast here:






Mozzarella isn't just a cheese, it's a work of art—at least the way it's made at Casa Della Mozzarella in the Bronx. Located on the corner of 187th Street and Arthur Avenue, the beloved Italian deli is helmed by father-son duo Orazio and Carlo Carciotto. Armed with little more than a pot of boiling water, a few pinches of salt, and an old wooden oar, the Carciottos pride themselves on turning blocks of lifeless cheese curds into molten cascades of creamy mozzarella. The shop is a stalwart in the Belmont section of the Bronx, and Carlo, in particular, was raised in the Italian enclave of Arthur Avenue—a strip of storefronts and restaurants increasingly referred to as NYC's ""real"" Little Italy. In this special installment of Food Skills, Carlo gives a behind-the-scenes tour of one of New York's most legendary neighborhoods, while Orazio breaks down the secrets to his uniquely American success story. In NYC, it's not difficult to a find a delicious pizza margherita, or a mind-blowing chicken parmigiana, but here, at Casa Della Mozzarella, cheese isn't just an ingredient, but a bucket-list meal all its own.

143,XDqtvbBb2e4,"LONDON STREET FOOD, BURGERS, SLOW COOKED PULLED PORK, PASTA, PIZZA, SAUSAGES","LONDON STREET FOOD, BURGERS, SLOW COOKED PULLED PORK, PASTA, PIZZA, SAUSAGES, INTERNATIONAL STREET FOOD, A hamburger, beefburger or burger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, or ""special sauce""; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.

The term ""burger"" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the term ""patty"" is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. The term may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in ""turkey burger"", ""bison burger"", or ""veggie burger"".

Hamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants (where burgers may sell for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu). There are many international and regional variations of the hamburger.  According to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the hamburger, a ground meat patty between two slices of bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut.[7] There have been rival claims by Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher Davis.[8][9] White Castle traces the origin of the hamburger to Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase.[10] However, it gained national recognition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the New York Tribune referred to the hamburger as ""the innovation of a food vendor on the pike"".[9] No conclusive argument has ever ended the dispute over invention. An article from ABC News sums up: ""One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that more than one person came up with the idea at the same time in different parts of the country.""[11]

Louis Lassen
Louis Lassen of Louis' Lunch, a small lunch wagon in New Haven, Connecticut, is said to have sold the first hamburger and steak sandwich in the U.S. in 1900.[12][13][14] New York magazine states that ""The dish actually had no name until some rowdy sailors from Hamburg named the meat on a bun after themselves years later"", noting also that this claim is subject to dispute.[15] A customer ordered a quick hot meal and Louis was out of steaks. Taking ground beef trimmings, Louis made a patty and grilled it, putting it between two slices of toast.[9] Some critics like Josh Ozersky, a food editor for New York Magazine, claim that this sandwich was not a hamburger because the bread was toasted.[16]

Charlie Nagreen
One of the earliest claims comes from Charlie Nagreen, who in 1885 sold a meatball between two slices of bread at the Seymour Fair[17] now sometimes called the Outagamie County Fair.[16] The Seymour Community Historical Society of Seymour, Wisconsin, credits Nagreen, now known as ""Hamburger Charlie"", with the invention. Nagreen was fifteen when he was reportedly selling pork sandwiches at the 1885 Seymour Fair, made so customers could eat while walking. The Historical Society explains that Nagreen named the hamburger after the Hamburg steak with which local German immigrants were familiar.  There have been many claims about the origin of the hamburger, but the origins remain unclear.[4] The popular book ""The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy"" by Hannah Glasse included a recipe in 1758 as ""Hamburgh sausage"", which suggested to serve it ""roasted with toasted bread under it"". A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg by the name ""Rundstück warm"" (""bread roll warm"") in 1869 or earlier,[5] and supposedly eaten by many emigrants on their way to America, but may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadeller. Hamburg steak is reported to have been served between two pieces of bread on the Hamburg America Line, which began operations in 1847. Each of these may mark the invention of the Hamburger, and explain the name.

There is a reference to a ""Hamburg steak"" as early as 1884 in the Boston Journal.[OED, under ""steak""] On July 5, 1896, the Chicago Daily Tribune made a highly specific claim regarding a ""hamburger sandwich"" in an article about a ""Sandwich Car"": ""A distinguished favorite, only five cents, is Hamburger steak sandwich, the meat for which is kept ready in small patties and 'cooked while you wait' on the gasoline range",Food

163,ZWVqIp3liQ,New York City Street Food - Roast Duck and Roast Pork Mantou,"Cantonese style roast duck and crispy roast pork served in steamed Chinese buns, and topped with thinly sliced cucumbers, scallions and sweet hoisin sauce.

Siu yuk (Chinese: 燒肉 / 火肉  literally: ""roast meat"") is a variety of siu mei, or roasted meat dishes, in Cantonese cuisine. It is made by roasting an entire pig with seasoning in a charcoal furnace at high temperature. Roasted pigs of high quality have crisp skin and juicy and tender meat. Usually the meat is served plain, but it is sometimes served with soy sauce or hoisin sauce. When individual pieces are served, it is known as ""roasted meat"" (Chinese: 燒肉; pinyin: shāo ròu; Cantonese Yale: sīu yuhk). When the entire pig is served, the dish is known as ""roasted pig"" (Chinese: 燒豬; pinyin: shāo zhū; Cantonese Yale: sīu jyū). In most cases it is referred to by the former term since it is always consumed in small quantities.

Other variations are Hornado in Ecuadorian cuisine, Lechon in Filipino cuisine, and Leitoa a pururuca in Brazilian cuisine.

Peking Duck is a famous duck dish from Beijing that has been prepared since the imperial era. The meat is prized for its thin, crisp skin, with authentic versions of the dish serving mostly the skin and little meat, sliced in front of the diners by the cook. Ducks bred specially for the dish are slaughtered after 65 days and seasoned before being roasted in a closed or hung oven. The meat is eaten with scallion, cucumber and sweet bean sauce with pancakes rolled around the fillings. Sometimes pickled radish is also inside, and other sauces (like hoisin sauce) can be used.",Food
164,BlxG04ftshk,"LONDON STREET FOOD, BIG SAUSAGES, HOT DOGS, POLISH KIELBASA,","LONDON STREET FOOD,  The hot dog[2][3] or dog (also spelled hotdog) is a grilled or steamed link-sausage sandwich where the sausage is served in the slit of a partially sliced hot dog bun, a bun of size and shape to hold the sausage.[4] It can also refer to the sausage (the wurst or wörst) of its composition itself. The sausage used is the wiener (Vienna sausage) or frankfurter (also frank). The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled sandwiches.[5] Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, and relish, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, chili, cheese, coleslaw, and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

These types of sausages and their sandwiches were culturally imported from Germany and became popular in the United States, where the ""hot dog"" became a working-class street food sold at hot dog stands and carts. The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary regionally in the US. Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century, and emerged as an important part of other regional cuisines, including notably Chicago street cuisine.  Hot dogs are commonly served with one or more condiments. In 2005, the US-based National Hot Dog & Sausage Council (part of the American Meat Institute) found mustard to be the most popular, preferred by 32% of respondents; 23% favored ketchup; 17% chili con carne; 9% pickle relish, and 7% onions. Other toppings include sauerkraut, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and chili peppers.

Condiment preferences vary across the U.S.. Southerners showed the strongest preference for chili, while Midwesterners showed the greatest affinity for ketchup.   An endless list of hot dog variations has emerged. The original leader, known today as a ""New York dog"" or ""New York style"", is a natural-casing all-beef frank topped with sauerkraut and spicy brown mustard, onions optional. Sauteed bell peppers, onions, and potatoes find their way into New Jersey's deep-fried Italian hot dog. In the midwest, the Chicago-style hot dog reigns, served on a poppyseed bun and topped with mustard, fresh tomatoes, onions, ""sport peppers"", bright green relish, dill pickles, and celery salt.

Many variations are named after regions other than the one in which they are popular. Meaty Michigan hot dogs are popular in upstate New York (as are white hots), while beefy Coney Island hot dogs are popular in Michigan. Hot wieners, or weenies, are a staple in Rhode Island where they are sold at restaurants with the misleading name ""New York System.""[46] Texas hot dogs are spicy variants found in upstate New York and Pennsylvania (and as ""all the way dogs"" in New Jersey), but not Texas.

Some baseball parks have signature hot dogs, such as Dodger Dogs at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, and Fenway Franks at Fenway Park in Boston, which are boiled then grilled,[citation needed] and served on a New England-style bun.  Kielbasa (from Polish kiełbasa[a]) is any type of meat sausage from Poland, and a staple of Polish cuisine. In American English, kielbasa typically refers to a course, u-shaped smoked sausage of any kind of meat, which closely resembles the Wiejska sausage (typically pork only) in British English.",Food
165,OFISmk_MK-Q,New York City Street Food - Mozzarella Sticks,"Mozzarella sticks are elongated pieces of battered or breaded mozzarella. Mozzarella sticks are a popular finger food, and may be served with tomato or marinara sauce, as well as plum sauce, jalapeño jelly, barbecue sauce, honey mustard sauce, and ranch dressing. Cheeses other than mozzarella are also fried, including provolone, Ashdubh, Edam, cheddar, and American. Mozzarella sticks with raspberry sauce are part of the regional cuisine of New York's Capital District. Once fried, the batter outside is lightly crispy while the cheese inside is melted and takes on a gooey consistency.",Food

170,97CWuI_hOe4,"HOT DOG, SAUSAGE, POLISH KIELBASA, HOT DOG SANDWICH, LONDON STREET FOOD,","HOT DOG, SAUSAGE, POLISH KIELBASA, HOT DOG SANDWICH,  LONDON STREET FOOD, The hot dog or dog (also spelled hotdog) is a grilled or steamed link-sausage sandwich where the sausage is served in the slit of a special hot dog bun, a partially sliced bun. It can also refer to just the sausage (the wurst or wörst) of its composition. Typical sausages include wiener (Vienna sausage), frankfurter (or frank), or knackwurst. The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled sandwiches.[2][3][4][5] Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, and relish, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, chili, cheese, coleslaw, and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile. Although schnitzel does not commonly refer to a link sausage, the fast food restaurant Wienerschnitzel is famous for its hot dogs.

These types of sausages and their sandwiches were culturally imported from Germany and popularized in the United States, where the ""hot dog"" became a working-class street food sold at hot dog stands and carts. The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary regionally in the US. Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century, and emerged as an important part of other regional cuisines (notably Chicago street cuisine).  
Grilled hot dogs
Ingredients
Common hot dog ingredients include:[28]

Meat trimmings and fat, e.g. mechanically separated meat, pink slime, meat slurry
Flavorings, such as salt, garlic, and paprika
Preservatives (cure) – typically sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite
Pork and beef are the traditional meats used in hot dogs. Less expensive hot dogs are often made from chicken or turkey, using low-cost mechanically separated poultry. Typical hot dog ingredients contain sodium, saturated fat and nitrite, which when consumed in excess have been linked to health problems. Changes in meat technology and dietary preferences have led manufacturers to use turkey, chicken, vegetarian meat substitutes, and to lower the salt content.

Commercial preparation
File:This Is Hormel (1964) hot dog segment.webm
Hormel hot dogs going into a smoker (1964)
Hot dogs are prepared commercially by mixing the ingredients (meats, spices, binders and fillers) in vats where rapidly moving blades grind and mix the ingredients in the same operation. This mixture is forced through tubes into casings for cooking. Most hot dogs sold in the US are ""skinless"" as opposed to more expensive ""natural casing"" hot dogs.

Natural-casing hot dogs
As with most sausages, hot dogs must be in a casing to be cooked. Traditional casing is made from the small intestines of sheep. The products are known as ""natural casing"" hot dogs or frankfurters.[29] These hot dogs have firmer texture and a ""snap"" that releases juices and flavor when the product is bitten.[29]

Kosher casings are expensive in commercial quantities in the US, so kosher hot dogs are usually skinless or made with reconstituted collagen casings.",Food
171,EyYDmTBMra0,New York City Street Food - Shaved Snow Ice Dessert,"Shaved snow served by Wooly's. 

""Shaved snow is a hybrid between shaved ice and ice cream. By taking a block of ice made with low-fat milk, flavors are infused into the blocks before it is frozen, and then shave it very fine to create a texture similar to fresh fallen snow.""

Flavors available are Original Leche, Coffee, and Melon. Optional toppings include Strawberry, Blueberry, Coconut Flakes,  Mochi, Pocky Sticks, Cookies 'n Cream, Graham Cracker Crumble, Captain Crunch, Fruity Pebbles, Corn Flakes, Sea Salt Leche, Chocolate Drizzle, Whipped Cream, and Strawberry Cream.

""Snow ice""—cream, milk, water, sugar and fruit, frozen and then shaved and served in cones—is popular in Korea, Taiwan and Indonesia and making inroads into the United States.

In Hawaii, ""shave ice"" is similar to snowballs, and is sold in cone-shaped paper cups. ""Rainbow,"" a popular flavor, consists of three colors of syrup chosen usually for their color rather than their taste compatibility. Commonly, a scoop of vanilla ice cream or sweetened azuki beans is first added to the bottom of the cup and is capped with condensed milk.

Vendors in Texas and northern Mexico serve finely shaved ice desserts. Called a raspa, they are usually sold from a roadside stand or trailer. They come in many flavors, including leche (milk and cinnamon) and picosito (the Spanish word for 'spicy' made with lemon and chili powder.)

The dessert ais kacang served in Malaysia and Singapore is another form of shaved ice. Ais kacang was originally served with red beans but now includes various fruits and other sweet toppings.
In Japan they are known as kakigori, and in India it is called a ""gola"" and usually served on popsicle sticks.

In Britain the term snow cone has been used for a standard ice cream cone topped with (usually vanilla) ice cream, hence the term snow cone.

In Perú this dessert is called Raspadilla, which is served in cups along with a spoon and/or a straw. It consists in ground ice which is thick and topped with juices of different flavors that can be combined, regularly the most common flavors are pineapple and strawberry juices but it can also be served with berries juice, passion fruit juice (maracuya), chicha morada (purple corn juice), and in some cases but uncommon it can be topped with condensed milk or yogurt. Its very popular in the beaches during summertime, but it also is consumed in the towns and the cities as well. It is sold in carts spread around some streets and avenues of the city, being prepared at the moment (some of them grind the ice in a block with a device or some spoon with a blade like razor in one end, others yet hace the ice already ground stored in a coolerbox) but all of them serve the portion of ice in the cup in front of the customer and then ask which flavor of juice would be poured on top of the ice, then they put a spoon and the straw.
 
Kala Khatta is a syrup made from the jambul fruit in India and some other parts of South Asia. It is primarily used as a flavoring for Indian ice lollipops or popsicles, sold as street food. Crushed ice is formed into a lump by hand and mounted on a stick to make the lollipop. Kala khatta syrup and seasonings such as salt and pepper are then poured on the lollipop.",Food

199,94Q6dJaIVMU,"LONDON STREET FOOD, BOROUGH MARKET, FRESH FOOD MARKET IN LONDON, BOROUGH","LONDON STREET FOOD, BOROUGH MARKET, FRESH FOOD MARKET IN LONDON, BOROUGH, Borough Market is a wholesale and retail food market in Southwark, London, England. It is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London,[1][2] with a market on the site dating back to at least the 12th century. The present buildings were built in the 1850s, and today the market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public.  The present market, located on Southwark Street and Borough High Street just south of Southwark Cathedral on the southern end of London Bridge, is a successor to one that originally adjoined the end of London Bridge. It was first mentioned in 1276, although the market itself claims to have existed since 1014 ""and probably much earlier""[3] and was subsequently moved south of St Margaret's church on the High Street.[4] The City of London received a royal charter from Edward VI in 1550 to control all markets in Southwark (see Guildable Manor), which was confirmed by Charles II in 1671. However, the market caused such traffic congestion that, in 1754, it was abolished by an Act of Parliament.[5][6]

The Act allowed for the local parishioners to set up another market on a new site, and in 1756, it began again on a 4.5-acre (18,000 m²) site in Rochester Yard.[5][6] During the 19th century, it became one of London's most important food markets due to its strategic position near the riverside wharves of the Pool of London.[5]

The retail market operates on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The wholesale market operates on all weekday mornings from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m.  The present-day market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public. However, in the 20th century, it was essentially a wholesale market, selling produce in quantity to greengrocers. It was the main supplier, along with Covent Garden, of fruits and vegetables to retail greengrocers' shops. Amongst the notable businesses trading in the market were Vitacress, Lee Brothers (potato merchants whose signage can still be seen in the market), Manny Sugarman, AW Bourne and Eddy Robbins. JO Sims, the main importer for South African citrus fruit (Outspan), were also located in the market.


Vegetable stall
Stallholders come to trade at the market from different parts of the UK, and traditional European products are also imported and sold. Amongst the produce on sale are fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, meat, game, baked bread and pastries.

The market is a charitable trust administered by a board of volunteer trustees, who have to live in the area.[10]

Borough Market and the surrounding streets have been used as a film location for such features as Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004).[11] As reported by the London Evening Standard, the market is available to hire for private events. From 1860, the railway operating companies desired to extend services from London Bridge station into new stations at Cannon Street and Blackfriars in the City and link to the West End at Charing Cross Station. This required a viaduct, but legally, it was impossible by the 1756 Borough Market Act for the Trustees to alienate their property. The compromise was that only a flying leasehold was given to the railway company for the permanent way, but only for as long as a railway operates on it. The Market continues to trade underneath the arches of the viaduct. Each time there is a railway expansion requiring widening of the viaduct, the Trustees receive a full compensation payment. The last major such expansion was the 1901 extended bridge widening; the 21st-century works programme will also make its contribution. These windfalls have assisted in the finances of the market without any loss of amenity to it. A new viaduct was erected above the market and a bridge across Borough High Street completed in 2014.


First span of the new Borough Market viaduct at Stoney Street
As part of the Thameslink Programme, a large number of listed buildings in the Borough Market area have been altered or demolished,[13] affecting the historic fabric of the area. This includes parts of the market itself and much of the area appearing in the aforementioned films. This was unpopular locally and became a contentious issue in the resulting public inquiry, which resulted in delays to the project. Eventually, the inquiry inspector was satisfied with the plans to restore as much of the market and surrounding area as possible. The overriding need to remove a major bottleneck in the national rail network and improve transport options over a large portion of London meant that he accepted that some damage to the fabric of the market and surrounding area was unavoidable in order for the scheme to achieve its objectives. Disruption to the market activities was kept to a minimum.",Food

201,-8pCMoL_b_,The Original New York Slice: The Pizza Show,"New York is the birthplace of many things, but for today's purposes, we're sticking to pizza. Frank starts with a quick history lesson from Scott Wiener, the owner of Scott's Pizza Tours. Then, we hit the streets to see and taste the history for ourselves. The best thing about the city's pizza scene is that it's relatively young, so you can still eat slices from the ovens of the people that started it all and put New York pizza on the map. 

We meet the granddaughters of the man that literally brought pizza over from Naples, and even see the ovens that he used. Then, we hit all the best slices from Greenwich Village to Soho, and finish in Brooklyn at Luigi's Pizza, a place untouched by time.

ABOUT FOOD AND FOOTPRINTS:

We are Greg and Jumi, hailing from opposite ends of the globe. Greg is a native New Yorker who was born and raised in Queens NYC and Jumi grew up in the beautiful islands of the Visayas region of the Philippines. 

How did we meet? One of us messaged the other on Instagram (before sliding in DM's was even possible through the app!) and we met just after Hurricane Sandy hit NYC in October 2012. Although we grew up in two very different worlds, we bonded over a love of experiences over material things, delicious food and exploration.

We have visited 15+ countries together since December 2014 exploring beaches, ancient temples, bustling streets and ruins. Along the way, we get adrenaline flowing whether paragliding, ziplining, or jetskiing.

To fuel up for our adventures (and everyday life), we eat lots of local food wherever we are. Street food, carts, trucks, hidden gems and family-run sit-downs are our mainstays. We don't cook, but prefer to spend our money on experiences and we treat food as one. Hey, we gotta eat regardless, right? May as well enjoy it and support good businesses while we're at it! 

All of this is done while we work full-time at our day jobs. How do we do it? Follow along our journeys and you will learn more. Welcome to our lifestyle!",Food

I am a huge fan of street food. In this webisode we headed to a restaurant in International City, Dubai which no one could stop talking about and known for bringing the street food from three major cities of the world, Shahi Paratha Roll.
Shahi Paratha Roll was started by Amir & Tayyeb out of their love and passion for street food, and none of the dishes on the menu were like anything we had tasted before.
Each dish had its own twist to it, weather it be international or desi. The dishes we tried were amazing especially the NY Chicken and Rice, which had been inspired by the street food of NYC.

241,FT7mNxMMoi0,"The Original Taco Bell Tacos - MEXICAN STREET FOOD Tour in Los Angeles, California!","►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts and caps available now: 

Thanks to Jeffrey Merrihue () and Austin Burgess ().

Along with Jeffrey and Austin - two food extreme friends, we set off on a day of Mexican food and fun feasting in greater LA.

Gilberto’s Taquiza - For the first stop on this Mexican street food tour, we drove all the way to West Covina, California, about 45 minutes from Central Los Angeles, to a little spot known as Gilberto’s Taquiza. Jeffrey made sure to call Gilberto himself to reserve some of the meat dripping dynamite sticks to make sure we had some. The dynamite sticks are essentially stewed lamb, cooked until fall apart tender and dripping with oil. In order to make them he dunked a tortilla into the hot oil, sizzled it on the hot plate, filled it with the fall apart tender meat, and rolled it up into a taquito. The result was spectacular. Everything else was delicious too, but the dynamite sticks were crazily good.
Total price - $35 for everything

Birrieria Guadalajara - Next we drove a little further towards Riverside, California, to eat birria, a special Mexican goat stew. Again, this is another Mexican food that just melts in your mouth, meat cooked until fall apart tender. It was spectacular and all the staff were very friendly as well.
Total price - $32 for everything

Mitla Cafe - Right across the street from Birrieria Guadalajara you will find Mitla Cafe, home to the original crunchy American taco. An American taco is a crunchy shell, ground beef, iceberg lettuce, yellow cheese, and tame salsa. As the true story goes, Glen Bell was selling food across the street and used to come to Mitla Cafe to eat their amazing crunchy tacos. Eventually he got the owner to show him how to make the crunchy tacos, and he later started the entire taco bell empire. The downside is that he never admitted that he got the idea and recipe from Mitla Cafe. It’s nice to see Mitla Cafe is still doing very well, and their crunchy American tacos are fantastic.
Price - $13.95

Taco Bell - Yes, just for comparison purposes, we had to go to the nearly Taco Bell. It had been years since I had last eaten taco bell. I have to admit the crunchy tacos were decent, but the crunchwrap supreme doritos locos thing we order, nope. That just didn’t do it for me.

Mariscos Jalisco - Finally to end this Mexican street food tour of LA, we headed to Mariscos Jalisco, a legendary seafood truck serving their famous shrimp tostadas and the Poseidon. They were delicious in every dimension, and it was the perfect ending to this full day of amazing Mexican food in LA.
Total price - $13 for everything

Thank you for watching this LA food video!

253,XGJjyvsjhG,New York Rooftops - Best Rooftop Observation Decks in New York,"When travel to USA New York, you will want to visit the best views of New York City, including the best rooftops in New York, the best roof terraces in New York and the best observation decks in New York. In this video I’ll show you some of the places to get the best views of New York City. New York is a massive city with amazing architecture and sky scrapers. This means that New York has some of the best and most iconic skylines of any city in the world. A trip to New York would be incomplete without a visit to at least one of the rooftops, terraces or observation decks featured in this video.

You can find information about all the New York observations decks, roof terraces and roof tops: 
-Rockefeller Centre: Top of the Rock Observation Deck:

-Upstairs at the Kimberly: 
-One World Observatory:   The One World Observation Deck was my favourite observation deck in New York for two reasons, one is that is offers spectacular views of Manhattan and two because there is an excellent restaurant / bar where you can spend hours enjoying the views and food. If you pick only one observation deck, then the One World Observatory is the one to go for.
-The High Line:  The High Line is an incredible example of industrial gentrification. This elevated train track has been repurposed into a walking garden, which offers excellent views of the West side of the city and the trendy Chelsea neighbourhood. This is one of my favourite spots in New York.
-Empire State Building:  
-Haven Rooftop:  The Haven Rooftop is not the best view in the city, but what they lack in views is made up in excellent vibe and amazing brunch menu.

258,NyXcyGeb7,The Best Hot Dog in NYC || 5 Buck Lunch,"In a town as fast-paced as NYC, a classic grab and go meal like a hot dog is a favorite for many New Yorkers and tourists alike. You can find the quintessential dirty-water dog on almost any corner in the city. But we don’t want a dirty water dog, we want next-level, mind-blowing hot dogs which are delicious and actually affordable. Join host Cody Reiss as he takes us to the dankest hot dog spot in downtown Manhattan for the cheapest lunch our duckets can buy. Crif Dogs in the East Village is serving up some of the best hot dogs in NYC and we’re showing you why. That is, after all, why Thrillist is your go-to, be all, end all, for food recommendations. You know the rules: We’ve only got $5, so we need to make every penny count... and we’ve definitely got you covered. 

Thrillist is bringing back its popular cheap-eats show, but bigger and better than ever with three new hosts. Every week, we’ll explore all the best places to eat (that actually taste good) for under $5, and not a penny more. This season, we’re taking it beyond just New York City and traveling to Washington, DC and the San Francisco Bay to show you where to get the best bang for your buck. So if you need a break from the expensive, the chains, or you’re just looking for new places to try in your city, this is the show for you. Welcome to “$5 Lunch.”

Cody Reiss is a Brooklyn-based food writer, comedian, and actor making video and written projects at the intersection of food and comedy. Over the past decade, he has traveled to over 35 countries and all over the US, working as a cook, farmer, cheese maker, and cheese monger. He’s tried over 400 cheeses and his favorite fruit is the fig.

270,NdrWJ7kELQ,"LONDON STREET FOOD, 1 METER LONG HOT DOG IN CAMDEN TOWN MARKET, LONDON STREET FOOD","LONDON STREET FOOD,  1 METER LONG HOT DOG IN CAMDEN TOWN MARKET, LONDON STREET FOOD, A hot dog (also spelled hotdog), also known as a frankfurter (sometimes shortened to frank) or wiener, is a cooked sausage, traditionally grilled or steamed and served in a partially sliced bun.[2][3][4][5] Typical garnishes include mustard, ketchup, onions, mayonnaise, relish, coleslaw, cheese, chili, olives, and sauerkraut. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pig in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

This type of sausage was culturally imported from Germany and popularized in the United States, where it became a working-class street food sold at hot dog stands and carts. The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary regionally in the US. Although particularly connected with New York City and New York City cuisine, the hot dog became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century, and emerged as an important part of some regional cuisines (notably Chicago street cuisine).  Claims about hot dog invention are difficult to assess, as stories assert the creation of the sausage, the placing of the sausage (or another kind of sausage) on bread or a bun as finger food, the popularization of the existing dish, or the application of the name ""hot dog"" to a sausage and bun combination most commonly used with ketchup or mustard and sometimes relish.

The word ""frankfurter"" comes from Frankfurt, Germany, where pork sausages similar to hot dogs originated.[9] These sausages, Frankfurter Würstchen, were known since the 13th century and given to the people on the event of imperial coronations, starting with the coronation of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor as King. ""Wiener"" refers to Vienna, Austria, whose German name is ""Wien"", home to a sausage made of a mixture of pork and beef.[10] Johann Georg Lahner, an 18th/19th century butcher from the Franconian city of Coburg, is said to have brought the Frankfurter Würstchen to Vienna, where he added beef to the mixture and simply called it Frankfurter.[11] Nowadays, in German-speaking countries, except Austria, hot dog sausages are called Wiener or Wiener Würstchen (Würstchen means ""little sausage""), in differentiation to the original pork-only mixture from Frankfurt. In Swiss German, it is called Wienerli, while in Austria the terms Frankfurter or Frankfurter Würstel are used.


Carts selling frankfurters in New York City, circa 1906. The price is listed as ""3 cents each or 2 for 5 cents"".
Others are credited with first serving hot dogs on rolls. A German immigrant named Feuchtwanger, from Frankfurt, in Hesse, allegedly pioneered the practice in the American midwest; there are several versions of the story with varying details. According to one account, Feuchtwanger's wife proposed the use of a bun in 1880: Feuchtwanger sold hot dogs on the streets of St. Louis, Missouri, and provided gloves to his customers so that they could handle the sausages without burning their hands. Losing money when customers did not return the gloves, Feuchtwanger's wife suggested serving the sausages in a roll instead.[12] In another version, Antoine Feuchtwanger, or Anton Ludwig Feuchtwanger, served sausages in rolls at the World's Fair – either at the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis,[13][14] or, earlier, at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, in Chicago[15] – again, allegedly because the white gloves provided to customers to protect their hands were being kept as souvenirs.[16]

Another possible origin for serving the sausages in rolls is the pieman Charles Feltman, at Coney Island in New York City. In 1867 he had a cart made with a stove on which to boil sausages, and a compartment to keep buns fresh in which they were served. In 1871 he leased land to build a permanent restaurant, and the business grew, selling far more than just the 'Coney Island Red Hots' as they were known.[17][18][19]

In 1916, a Polish American employee of Feltman's named Nathan Handwerker was encouraged by Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante, both working as waiters/musicians, to go into business in competition with his former employer.[20] Handwerker undercut Feltman's by charging five cents for a hot dog when his former employer was charging ten.[20]

At an earlier time in food regulation, when the hot dog was suspect, Handwerker made sure that men wearing surgeon's smocks were seen eating at Nathan's Famous to reassure potential customers.[16]",Food

Street food is ready-to-eat food or drink sold by a hawker, or vendor, in a street or other public place, such as at a market or fair. It is often sold from a portable food booth, food cart, or food truck and meant for immediate consumption. Some street foods are regional, but many have spread beyond their region of origin. Most street foods are classed as both finger food and fast food, and are cheaper on average than restaurant meals. According to a 2007 study from the Food and Agriculture Organization, 2.5 billion people eat street food every day.

Today, people may purchase street food for a number of reasons, such as to get flavourful food for a reasonable price in a sociable setting, to experience ethnic cuisines, or for nostalgia.

Street food vending is found all around the world, but varies greatly between regions and cultures. For example, Dorling Kindersley describes the street food of Vietnam as being ""fresh and lighter than many of the cuisines in the area"" and ""draw[ing] heavily on herbs, chile peppers and lime"", while street food of Thailand is ""fiery"" and ""pungent with shrimp paste ... and fish sauce."" New York City's signature street food is the hot dog, however, New York street food also includes everything from ""spicy Middle Eastern falafel or Jamaican jerk chicken to Belgian waffles""

Street food in Thailand offers various selection of ready-to-eat meals, snacks, fruits and drinks sold by hawkers or vendors at food stalls or food carts on the street side. Bangkok is often mentioned as one of the best place for street food. Popular street offerings includes pad thai (stir fried rice noodle), som tam (green papaya salad), sour tom yum soup, various selection of Thai curries, to sticky rice mango

Indonesian street food is a diverse mix of local Indonesian, Chinese, and Dutch influences. Indonesian street food often tastes rather strong and spicy. A lot of street food in Indonesia are fried, such as local gorengan (fritters), also nasi goreng and ayam goreng, while bakso meatball soup, skewered chicken satay and gado-gado vegetable salad served in peanut sauce are also popular.

Indian street food is as diverse as Indian cuisine. Every region has its own specialties to offer. Some of the more popular street food dishes are Vada Pav, Cholle Bhature, Parathas, Rolls, Bhel Puri, Sev Puri, Gol Gappa, Aloo tikki, Kebabs, Tandoori chicken, Samosa, Bread omelette, Pav bhaji and Pakora.In India, street food is popularly known as nukkadwala food. There are several restaurants and QSRs in India that have also taken their inspiration from the vibrant street food of India.

In Hawaii, the local street food tradition of ""plate lunch"" (rice, macaroni salad, and a portion of meat) was inspired by the bento of the Japanese who had been brought to Hawaii as plantation workers. In Denmark, sausage wagons allow passersby to purchase sausages and hot dogs.

In Egypt, a food sold commonly on the street is ful, a slow-cooked fava bean dish",Food

A narrated walk down Fifth Avenue from the 5th Avenue - 59th Street Station to 23rd Street, where the Flatiron Building is located.

Correction and Additions: 
At  St. Patrick's Cathedral is designed in the Neo-Gothic Style. I already knew it was Neo-Gothic Style but there was a lot on my mind and mistakenly said it was Art Deco Style.

At  I state ""Personally, I don't give money out to homeless on the streets because you never know what they'll do with it, and what their causes will be"". I believe it is important for society to help the homeless and people who are less fortunate. It is important to make charitable contributions to the less fortunate and the homeless, so whether that means giving directly to homeless on the streets or to reputable organizations is up to the donor. I am more comfortable providing aid through a third party as there have been many scams in New York. On a previous narrated walk down Manhattan's Broadway:  I suggest donating to reputable organizations instead. Personally, I don’t donate money to people on the streets. However, I will give food, supplies and support the homeless and less fortunate through other means and organizations. There have been reports of organized scams preying on people’s good intentions. See this news story: . At  I mention this scam.

295,xLbY1lJATKk,RAMLY BURGER- epic MALAYSIA STREET FOOD BURGER | Food and Travel Channel | Kuala Lumpur,"Subscribe for more food and travel videos: https://goo.gl/9rfeRS
The Ramly Burger is a Malaysia street food burger that is dear to the hearts of most Malaysians! The Ramly burger has been around since the late 70s and was created by its founder to fill a gap in the Halal Western food market. These greasy, saucy burgers can be found everywhere in Malaysia and are often set up as a street cart or vendors operate out of the back of a van or truck. 

At its simplest, a Ramly Burger usually consists of either a beef or chicken patty, shredded cabbage, cucumber, mayo, BBQ sauce  sweet chilli sauce or ketchup. We suggest you order a ‘Special’ which sees an egg cracked onto the hot plate, spread into a thin omelette and the patty which has been halved and filled with sauce then put inside the egg and wrapped up. It’s a genius way of making sure the sauces don’t spew out of the burger patty.

If you’re a burger gourmand then the Ramly Burger is probably not for you but if you’re up for a greasy, messy, satisfying street burger, don’t hesitate to give the Ramly Burger a go!

300,27laMmKcivk,"Italian Street Food: Hand Rolled Pasta Fettuccine Alfredo by Cheese Wheel, Camden Lock Market London","Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mr07623445678/

✓ Welcome to Cheese Heaven!!! Because in this video we visit the UK's first Cheese Wheel stall, they're serving up freshly hand rolled fettuccine pasta, smothered with divine home style sauces and..........here's the best bit: tossed in a massive Cheese Wheel........that right a MASSIVE 40 Kilogram Ball of Grana Pagano Parmesan Cheese Cove.

Fettuccine Alfredo or (fettuccine al burro) is a pasta dish made from fettuccine ribbons tossed with Parmesan cheese and butter, just as the cheese melts, it emulsifies the liquids to form an intensely cheesy, smooth and rich coating on to the pasta.

The homemade signature White Wine Cream Sauce here is flavoured with Parmesan, Garlic and Fresh Chives.

The Vegetarian and (non veg) toppings offered are:
* Wild Mushroom Sauté.
* Basil Pesto and Semi Sun Dried Tomato.
* Smoked Pancetta (Crispy Bacon).
* Smoked + Cured Pork & Leek Italian Sausage.
* Truffle Carpaccio.
* Prawns.

They hand make the pasta while you wait - there is no secret to the recipe and preparation because everything is hand made in full view of you while you wait.

You can call it delicious restaurant quality food; but at very affordable Indian street food prices!!!

Here's links to The Cheese Wheel's various social media:

Twitter and Facebook pages: @Thewheeluk

By serving up the cheesiest pasta in London.........In April 2017 Timeout magazine gave these guys a 5 out of 5 rating and were named officially as London's Cheesiest dish.

The Cheese Wheel is located in the West Yard of Camden Lock Market; in the KERB Street Food Market section area right next to the scenic Regents Canal.

If you're travelling specially to taste something specific (and want to confirm that it's on the menu on the day of your visit) or if you have any questions about opening times etc... you can call them on: 07894 473 885

A special thank you to Graham Bradbury and all of the Cheese Wheel team who very much welcomed us and graciously allowed us a privileged glimpse into their kitchen to do the videoing.

T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l

One of the top things to do in Chiang Mai is walk around and eat through one of the many Chiang Mai night markets - I think Chiang Mai might be the capital of night markets in the world. There’s a night market for every day of the week and some of them stretch longer than you can see. 

At night markets in Chiang Mai you’ll find a huge selection of things to buy, from clothes and antiques to even entertainment like music and Thai massage. But for food lovers, the best thing about visiting any Thai night market is the food.

On Sunday night in Chiang Mai the most popular night market is Tha Pae Walking Street (ตลาดท่าแพ) - it really is an entire street that shuts down for a couple of kilometers, and the entire street is filled with things to look at, buy, and eat. Most of the food is set up in designated area, especially in the small courtyards of temples.

In this Thai street food tour of Chiang Mai, the plan was just to walk around and see what looked good to eat.

Here’s what we ate:

Sai krok Isaan (ไส้กรอกอีสาน), Sai ua (ไส้อั่ว) - This impressive cart was filled with different varieties of Thai sausage, both Isaan style sausage, and Northern Thai herb sausage.
Total price - 30 THB ($0.91)

Pork meatballs (ลูกชิ้นหมู) - I’m usually not a huge fan, but these 100% pork meatballs were pretty tasty.
Price - 40 THB ($1.21)

Pork ham (หมูยอ) - After meeting up with my friends Tom, Joel, and JJ, they had already been snacking on some moo yaw, a Vietnamese style ham sausage.

Grilled egg (ไข่ป่าม) - This is a unique Northern Thai food, of grilled egg.
Price - 30 THB ($0.91) 

Sticky rice (ข้าวหนุกงา) - One of the Thai snacks I had never tried before were sticky rice patties. They were interesting and quite tasty.
Price - 20 THB ($0.61)

Pork ribs (ซี่โครงหมู), Crab egg custard (อ่องปู) - We saw the ribs being grilled and couldn't’t resist. They were alright, but the paddy crab egg custard was more unique.
Price - 180 THB ($5.46) 

Durian (ทุเรียน) - Finally, although a little overpriced, and not season, we couldn’t resist a little nugget of durian to end this Chiang Mai night market Thai food tour.
Price - 200 THB ($6.06) 

Featuring Tom from Chaseki Tea () and Joel ().

323,-4qv1TWzq0I,"LONDON STREET FOOD, HOT DOGS, SAUSAGES, POLISH KIELBASA, LEICESTER SQUARE,","LONDON STREET FOOD, HOT DOGS, SAUSAGES, POLISH KIELBASA, LEICESTER SQUARE, The hot dog, or dog (also spelled hotdog) is a grilled or steamed link-sausage sandwich where the sausage is served in the slit of a partially sliced hot dog bun, a bun of size and shape to hold the sausage.[4] It can also refer to the sausage (the wurst or wörst) of its composition itself. The sausage used is the wiener (Vienna sausage) or frankfurter (also frank). The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled sandwiches.[5] Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, and relish, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, chili, cheese, coleslaw, and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

These types of sausages and their sandwiches were culturally imported from Germany and became popular in the United States, where the ""hot dog"" became a working-class street food sold at hot dog stands and carts. The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary regionally in the US. Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century, and emerged as an important part of other regional cuisines, including notably Chicago street cuisine.  Claims about the invention of the hot dog are difficult to assess, as different stories assert different origins for the distinction between hot dogs and other similar foods. The history of the dish may begin with the creation of the sausage, with the placing of the sausage on bread or a bun as finger food, with the popularization of the existing dish, or with the application of the name ""hot dog"" to a sausage and bun combination most commonly used with ketchup or mustard and sometimes relish.

The word ""frankfurter"" comes from Frankfurt, Germany, where pork sausages similar to hot dogs originated.[9] These sausages, Frankfurter Würstchen, were known since the 13th century and given to the people on the event of imperial coronations, starting with the coronation of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor as King. ""Wiener"" refers to Vienna, Austria, whose German name is ""Wien"", home to a sausage made of a mixture of pork and beef.[10] Johann Georg Lahner, an 18th/19th century butcher from the Franconian city of Coburg, is said to have brought the Frankfurter Würstchen to Vienna, where he added beef to the mixture and simply called it Frankfurter.[11] Nowadays, in German-speaking countries, except Austria, hot dog sausages are called Wiener or Wiener Würstchen (Würstchen means ""little sausage""), in differentiation to the original pork-only mixture from Frankfurt. In Swiss German, it is called Wienerli, while in Austria the terms Frankfurter or Frankfurter Würstel are used.",Food
324,6ffL3PJ2Og,The Pizza Show: NYC's Other Boroughs,"Frank Pinello has eaten his share of pizza in Manhattan and Brooklyn, but it's time for him to check out New York City's other boroughs—Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx—to discover some of the city's best slices and pies. We start off in Queens with our favorite Renaissance man Action Bronson for a slice tour of two of his favorite places. 

Then we're off to Staten Island with VICE security guard and foodie extraordinaire Vic Zagami to get some crispy bar pies and the legendary vodka pie at Goodfella's. The episode ends with a visit to the Bronx for a walk down Arthur Avenue with Mark Iacono, Frank's favorite pizza friend. Frank and Mark's walk is filled with fresh cheese, prosciutto, clams, tripe—and, of course, more pizza.

330,TKoxzuSyvfY,Pizza Bagel: The Most New York Food Ever? || Really Dough?,"The formula of a pizza (“sauce, dough and cheese”) is sacred to old-school Brooklyn pizzaiolos like Lucali owner Mark Iacono. But renowned pizza enthusiast Scott Weiner believes that the beauty of the slice comes from it’s creative customizability; whether it’s a pizza made topped with tacos, gold, or re-constructed entirely from a bowl of ramen noodles. So with these franken-pizzas emerging fast onto the classic NYC scene, it’s Scott’s mission to deliver Mark a novel slice that will challenge his notions and spark the debate: what REALLY makes, or breaks, the definition of a “pizza”?

The Pizza Bagel from Baz Bagels may come from the streets of New York City’s Little Italy, but is it built on a thick, doughy, fundamental pizza flaw? Baz’s garlic bagel, topped with Di Palo tomato sauce and grande mozzarella cheese is a melty masterpiece, but Scott isn’t sure that a pizza can truly live atop a bagel. Can it “Really, Dough?!” The final verdict belongs to Mark, so Scott brings a couple to Lucali to see get the word from the pizza professional.

331,TnrccljYfM,"CEBUANO Street Food + Talisay LECHON / Cebu, Philippines 🇵🇭","Hellllooooo Philippines!!!!

Oh it feels so good to be in the Philippines. I didn’t waste much time as I met up with my friend @iamfromcebu and dove deep into the street food scene of Cebu.

Started off with the traditional pungko-pungko a way to take a squat, grab some yummy fried food, and enjoy it all dipped in a sugar cane vinegar. 

Then we headed to eat some siomai, but before made a stop at the dried fish market to check out some of the most popular exported goods from the Philippines.  Then we arrived at Siomai sa Tisa, for one of the coolest ways I have ever enjoyed Siomai.

Onwards we went for pure street food this time to try tuslob buwa a dish that has pig brain, liver, cornstarch, and fish sauce all cooked over a high open flame and scooped up with as many puso as you want! While there I got to try a flavor packed soup that would rival sinagang’s sourness. 

Finally, we made it for some Lechon de Talisay. This place was crowded as locals were lining up to get their lechon fix. After taking a bite and realizing the magic of Cebu Lechon, I had to make a promise to eat it every day while in the Philippines. 

Of course, now I was most excited as I got the opportunity to try some local delicacies that are on the sweeter side! I got to sample about 5 little treats all together, but the mangos and utop were hands down my favorite. 

This is the first video of a huge series from the Philippines. Make sure to stay up to date and connected with me! Hope you all enjoy as I am so excited for this!

335,LI18kU6A0,Garbage Plates: Rochester's Best-Kept Secret || Food/Groups,"People are shocked to hear that Rochester, a one-time boomtown on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, is actually the third-biggest city in the Empire State. It might not have New York City’s international cachet, or Buffalo’s diehard sports traditions, but Rochester has something arguably even better: the garbage plate. 

It’s a glorious, 3000-calorie gutbuster of greasy lunch counter staples, from macaroni salad to cheeseburgers, and it brings this Rust Belt city together across lines of class, race, and generation.

336,lZSLfCBYRsg,United Airlines Review - Business Class from Lisbon to New York City (and NYC Pizza),"We flew from Lisbon to NYC on United Airlines - business class food review.

►Watch the full series: 

On Day 28 of our Round The World Trip with Star Alliance we flew from Lisbon, Portugal to Newark (but going to New York City) on United Airlines business class. I wasn’t expecting that much from United Airlines, but it turned out to be a great flight, with amazing service, and surprisingly very good food. Here’s the full United Airlines flight review.

 Lunch on United Airlines: Lisbon to New York City - Since we boarded the flight in the morning, the first meal we at on the flight is lunch. I chose to order salmon with couscous with some kind of sauce on it. The salmon paired with the couscous and tomatoey sauce was delicious. It was a full gourmet meal experience on business class.

 Dinner on United Airlines - After taking a nap for a few hours and watching a couple movies, it was time for another meal… I think it was dinner this time? Since they had salmon on the menu again, I couldn’t resist. Again, it was good.

 Newark Liberty International Airport - We arrived to Newark airport after about a 6 hour flight from Lisbon, Portugal. From the airport after passing from customs and immigration we went to the train station and bought tickets for $13 from Newark to NY Penn Station Manhattan.

 Courtyard New York Manhattan / Chelsea - In New York City, my wife and I stayed at Courtyard New York Manhattan / Chelsea, located just a 5 minute walk from NY Penn Station. We checked into the hotel and our room was fantastic with a great view of NYC.

 Joe's Pizza - Without a doubt, pizza is one of the most famous foods to eat in NYC, and so it was only fitting that my first meal in NYC would be pizza. After walking around for a while, Ying and I were not too far from Joe's Pizza, one of the many legendary pizza slice restaurants in New York City. The pizza was pretty good, and it had actually been a while since I had eaten pizza. Price - $2.75 for cheese slice, $3.75 for pepperoni.

It was a good but tiring day, and I our flight on United Airlines was very nice. Welcome to New York City - more food coming!

Disclaimer and Thank You: 
Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets () for sponsoring my business class flights.

343,qZRe6K5V9A,NYC’s Home for All Things Pho || Eat Seeker: Di An Di,"There’s more to a dish than what’s served on a plate. A chef’s food can act as a voice to share a story, whether that be a tale of identity crisis or a struggle to find a place in an established cuisine. Eat Seeker delves deeper into the meaning behind the dishes that represent the chef and looks at what motivates their cuisine.

When Tuan Bui and Dennis Ngo opened their first restaurant in New York, they quickly noticed that New York was not home to a large Vietnamese community like the ones they were accustomed to in their home states of Virginia and Texas. The owners of Di An Di grew to miss those communities, especially when it comes to the food. With their new restaurant, the goal is to showcase food from both from their travels to Vietnam, like their pho with scallions sliced on the bias, wok stir-fried beef and an egg yolk inspired by a bowl they slurped up at tiny shop in Hanoi, and dishes like dry chicken pho similar to one Tuan tried when he visited Houston years back. They hope that their food can help open New Yorkers' eyes to the versatility of Vietnamese cuisine and help build a strong Vietnamese community in the city.

Indian Street A kati roll (sometimes misspelled kathi roll; Bengali: কাটি রোল) is a street-food dish originating from Kolkata, India. In its original form, it is a skewer-roasted kebab wrapped in a paratha bread, although over the years many variants have evolved all of which now go under the generic name of kati roll. Today, mostly any wrap containing a filling enfolded in an Indian flatbread (roti) is called a kati roll Food Street Food in Mumbai Halwa Paratha

346,khOnPaKZ8U,Street Food in Bangkok - Awesome PAD THAI and Instant Noodles on Petchaburi Soi 5!,"Petchaburi Soi 5 is one of the best Bangkok street food streets!
►Watch the full videos in this playlist: 
►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: 

Petchaburi Soi 5 (เพชรบุรี ซอย 5) has long been one of my go-to street food streets in Bangkok. Starting in the evening at around 4 pm, the entire road starts to fill with street food carts selling all sorts of Thai dishes. You’ll find everything from rice and curry to soup noodles, snacks, and fresh fruits and vegetables. It had been a few years since I had explore Petchaburi Soi 5 (เพชรบุรี ซอย 5), so in this Thai street food tour I’m taking you with me to some of my old favorites, and some new spots. Enjoy!

Yam mama (ยำมาม่า) - 50 THB ($1.52) - This is the first dish I tried. MAMA are Thai instant noodles and this is a completely different way to eat them - in mixed salad form.

Khanom krok (ขนมครก) - 30 THB ($0.92) - Coconut griddle cakes are one of my favorites, they are crunchy on the outside and gooey in the center. Don’t miss this Thai street food snack.

Cha yen (ชาเย็น) - 25 THB ($0.76) per cup - Thai tea

Pad thai (ผัดไทย), Hoy tod (หอยทอด) - This was formerly a street food cart that now has their own permanent shophouse location. They make pretty decent Pad Thai and they hoy tod, which in this case in a mussels omelet, is pretty good as well.
Total price - 125 THB ($3.81)

Nam prik pla too (น้ำพริกปลาทู) - For something a little healthier, I’m a huge fan of nam pirk pla too, a pounded chili mackerel sauce that’s eaten with vegetables.
Total price - 70 THB ($2.14) for everything

Chao guay (เฉาก๋วย) - 25 THB ($0.76) - For dessert, I had grass jelly with ice. The owner was so friendly and happy.

Haircut - 100 THB ($3.05)

Pad kra prao moo krob kai dao (ผัดกระเพราหมูกรอบไข่ดาว) - Final meal of this Bangkok street food tour, I headed across the street to Petchaburi Soi 10 to seek out one of my old time favorites. The stall was still there, and they make a pretty good plate of Thai crispy pork belly fried with basil.
Price - 40 THB ($1.22)

Thank you for joining me on this Thai street food tour of Petchaburi Soi 5 (เพชรบุรี ซอย 5). It’s the type of street you can walk through and just choose whatever you like to eat.

348,xMFbpjhzxY,Crispy Scallion Pancake Sandwiches in NYC || Fork Yeah: Little Tong,"Specializing in Yunnan-style noodle soup, Little Tong Noodle Shop led the charge in New York City’s recent rice-noodle wave. One night after a long service, chef/owner Simone Tong accidentally stumbled on her latest creation, the JB Melt, while making a family meal for her staff. Grabbing scallion pancakes, she began to serve her staff taco-like sandwiches filled with her six-hour braised beef shank and gooey melted cheese. After some tweaking and refining, the JB Melt was born and added to the menu at the restaurant’s Midtown location, where they specialize in lunch.

Adventurous eaters welcome.

At about 10 p.m., a small-of-stature woman sitting behind a table that's in front of a large, white food truck turns around and picks up the microphone, making an announcement in a high, sweet voice over the crowd of people on the sidewalk. You can't really make out but every other word. ""[LOUD INAUDIBLE] DOLLAR HITS [ECHO ECHO] EVERYTHING'S ONE DOLLAR [ECHO ECHO].""

354,IuKg9S1BoOk,Betty's Husband Rick Makes New York Street Hot Dogs,"Betty's husband, Rick, demonstrates how to make a classic New York hot dog as sold from carts throughout the city.  It has a great taste and is easy and inexpensive to make to feed a crowd.

New York Street Hot Dogs

For the onion sauce:

2-3 tablespoons olive oil (or any frying oil)
1 medium onion, sliced about 1/4 inch thick
2 cloves minced or pressed garlic
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
2 tablespoons ketchup
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
cayenne hot sauce to taste (used about one teaspoon)
ground black pepper to taste
1 teaspoon brown sugar (optional--I skipped it)
1 teaspoon dijon mustard

Saute the onions in the oil over medium heat until they begin to soften.  Add the garlic and cook until the onions are completely soft.  Add the remaining ingredients and simmer for about 10 minutes until the sauce is thickened to your liking.  Remove from heat.

In a pot large enough to hold your hot dogs (preferably all-beef), add sufficient water to cover the dogs (but do not add them yet).  Bring water just to a boil.  Reduce to a simmer and add the dogs.  Heat for about 10 minutes. If you wish, steam the buns for the last two minutes until they are warm and soft.

Place dogs on buns.  Add a squirt of horseradish mustard and a few spoonfuls of the onion sauce on top.  Eat gingerly, expecting spillage.  Go ahead and lick it up when it does.

Kali ini The Permanas nyobain The Halal Boys di kemang, Jakarta, Indonesia. Kita sudah nunggu lama si Halal Guys yang dari US / New York di buka di Jakarta, sampaui sekarang masih belum juga. Jadi untuk mengobati penasaran, kita makan Halal Boys dulu aja!

Halal Boys ini adalah merek lokal, dan sepertinya memang mencoba mengkopi kesuksesan dari Halal Guys yang di US, New York. Dari sisi rasa so far sih oke, hanya kita memang belum coba Halal Guys seperti apa. Saya pernah sih makan waktu di Manila, sepertinya sih dari segi rasa lumayan hampir mirip, cuma memang yang saya ingat Halal Guys itu porsinya gede!

Untuk yang suka makanan timur tengah pasti suka dengan rasa Halal Boys ini. Harga juga okelah untuk kelas makanan pinggir jalan, so far sih Halal Boys belum masuk Mall.

358,nFClH-XbgyU,Chelsea Market Food You Have to Try Now,"Snacking and shopping addicts flock to Chelsea Market, New York’s most notable food hall. Boasting more than 35 vendors, the hot spot has whatever you're hankering for, including a steaming-hot cup of lobster bisque, perfectly aged cheese or a strong shot of espresso. But with so much to choose from, it's hard to choose just one (okay, or three) Chelsea Market foods to whet your appetite. That's where we come in! 

We ate our way through the many food sellers and crowned the five best things to eat at Chelsea Market. 

1. Los Tacos No. 1: Start with one of the best taco joints in the city 

2. Dickson’s Farmstead Meats: You can nab charcuterie or a house-made hot dog—save room!

3. Seed + Mill: Pick up fresh-ground tahini or halva

4. Dizengoff: Dip into hummus with fresh pita bread and Israeli salad

5. Creamline: Finish it all off with a sumptuous milkshake

Still want more Chelsea Market food? Hit Bar Suzette for its French onion soup-inspired creation or opt for a sweet, Nutella and fruit-filled pancake. Seafood worshippers will go nuts inside The Lobster Place—a wholesale and retail fish market, which serves fresh and prepared meals like lobster roll and sushi. When you need to oblige your sweet tooth, hit the pint-sized Doughnuttery stand for mouth-watering bite-sized desserts. (You can watch the doughnuts come fresh off the conveyor belt and choose your own toppings.) Chelsea market also reps great restaurants like a rustic, classy spot called The Tippler. Happy eating!

362,lzAk5wAImFQ,Making New York-style pizza at home,"New York-style pizza at home

(Makes four 12-inch pizzas)

For the dough:

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
¼ cup warm water

2 cups warm water
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt
¼ cup olive oil
5 cups bread flour, plus more as needed

Bloom the yeast in a stand mixer bowl with the teaspoon of sugar and ¼ cup water. When it’s frothy, add the rest of the ingredients and mix with the dough hook until a smooth ball comes together. It should be only slightly sticky; if it’s very sticky, add additional flour. Divide dough into four equal parts, roll each into a smooth ball and place in its own, well-oiled bowl. Age in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours or up to a week.

For the sauce:

1 28-ounce can whole San Marzano tomatoes
¼ cup olive oil
½ teaspoon sugar, or more to taste
1 teaspoon dried oregano
2 tablespoons tomato paste

Remove tomatoes from their canning liquid and discard the liquid. Squish or blend the tomatoes until smooth. Add remaining ingredients and mix until smooth. Makes enough for four pizzas.

For the cheese:

6 ounces whole-milk, low-moisture mozzarella per pizza
Grated parmesan for dusting

Assembly:

Place pizza stone on middle rack and preheat oven on its maximum temperature for one hour. Use convection setting, if available. After pre-heating, stretch pizza dough and place on a well-dusted peel (stone-ground whole-wheat flour works best). Top with sauce, dusting of parmesan, and then the mozzarella. Bake for 5-6 minutes. Rest on cooling rack before slicing.",Food

365,lNxAR_M1UUA,"Indian Street Food - 10 of the BEST Foods To Eat in Mumbai, India!","Indian street food in Mumbai is exciting and mouthwatering!
► SUBSCRIBE NOW for more street food: 
► Read the Blog post: 
► Watch my Indian food playlist: 

There are dozens of Indian street foods you can eat when you’re in Mumbai, there are delicious looking delicacies everywhere you look in the city. But in this video you’ll discover a top 10 list of a few of the best Indian street food dishes that you don’t want to miss when you’re in Mumbai.

For details about all these Mumbai street food stalls, read my blog post: 

1. Vada Pav - One of the most popular Mumbai street foods is vada pav, a spiced mashed potato patty that’s deep fried and stuffed into a bun along with chutney. Although it sounds simple and it is, it’s one of the greatest vegetarian burgers you’ll likely ever eat. Also, when you eat vada pav, don’t miss eating some fried chili's to go with it.

2. Bhelpuri - Another of the of the foods that’s iconic in Mumbai is bhelpuri, a snack made from puffed rice, mixed with chutney, and onions and tomatoes. It’s an Indian street food in Mumbai that’s especially common at beaches, and it makes a fantastic beach food. I tried the bhelpuri in this video at Juhu Beach.

3. Sev Puri - This is one of my personal favorite Indian street food chaats, a combination of little crispy disc chips topped with mashed potatoes, onions, and a variety of delicious chutneys, and a handful of sev, which are the all the little crispy things on top. When you take a bit of sev puri, the entire little disc will explode with delicious flavors, and it’s all about that chutney!

4. Pav Bhaji - Originally made from leftover vegetables that were mashed up, mixed with some butter and spices, and served with bread to mop it all up, pav bhaji is pretty much exactly that today, and it’s an Indian street food known for being popular in Mumbai. At some of the famous pav bhaji stalls, the mixture of potatoes and tomatoes is mashed up on a big hot plate, mixed with spices and butter, and then served with buttered fluffy buns.

5. Kebabs and Rolls - For any meat lovers, kebabs and rolls are one of the best things to eat in Mumbai. I especially enjoyed the bhuna roll in Mumbai, a wonderfully flavorful chicken curry packed into a thin rumali roti.

6. Chai - It’s not a food, but it is one of the joys of being in India, and that is drinking cups of hot chai on the side of the street. You don’t want to miss it when you’re in Mumbai.

7. Pani Puri - Popular as a street food snack across India, pani puri is the combination of little puris (hollow sphere chips) filled with potatoes and chickpeas, and then filled with chutney and flavored water. Each bite is a burst of incredible flavor and water.

8. Bombay Duck Fry - Although it’s commonly eaten at indoor restaurant, because of it’s importance in Mumbai, and since it’s served at local restaurants, I had to include it on this list of Mumbai food. Known at Bombay duck or bombil, it’s actually a type of lizardfish which is often deep fried and served with rice and side curries. It’s something you should try when you’re in Mumbai.

9. Mumbai Sandwich (Bombay Sandwich) - You don’t usually think of sandwiches when you think of Indian street food, but in Mumbai, the sandwich is one of the most popular roadside snacks. Often times pure vegetarian, a combination of masala potatoes, tomatoes, onions, beetroot, cheese, and chutney is pressed between bread, and grilled over fired. The result is a fascinating street sandwich you’ll never forget.

10. Dosa - Although from South India, Mumbai is a hub of Indian food, and you’ll find dosas all over Mumbai as well. The classic traditional version is a masala dosa, but there are also fusion types of dosas, including the paneer tikka dosa, which is absolutely magical.

Thank you for watching this video about the top 10 Indian street foods to eat when you’re in Mumbai. Hope you have an amazing time eating!

367,M2sMUYHJEIg,"LONDON STREET FOOD, BOROUGH MARKET","LONDON STREET FOOD, BOROUGH MARKET, Borough Market is a wholesale and retail food market in Southwark, London, England. It is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London,[1][2] with a market on the site dating back to at least the 12th century. The present buildings were built in the 1850s, and today the market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public.  The present market, located on Southwark Street and Borough High Street just south of Southwark Cathedral on the southern end of London Bridge, is a successor to one that originally adjoined the end of London Bridge. It was first mentioned in 1276, although the market itself claims to have existed since 1014 ""and probably much earlier""[3] and was subsequently moved south of St Margaret's church on the High Street.[4] The City of London received a royal charter from Edward VI in 1550 to control all markets in Southwark (see Guildable Manor), which was confirmed by Charles II in 1671. However, the market caused such traffic congestion that, in 1754, it was abolished by an Act of Parliament.[5][6]

The Act allowed for the local parishioners to set up another market on a new site, and in 1756, it began again on a 4.5-acre (18,000 m²) site in Rochester Yard.[5][6] During the 19th century, it became one of London's most important food markets due to its strategic position near the riverside wharves of the Pool of London.[5]

The retail market operates on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The wholesale market operates on all weekday mornings from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m.  The present-day market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public. However, in the 20th century, it was essentially a wholesale market, selling produce in quantity to greengrocers. It was the main supplier, along with Covent Garden, of fruits and vegetables to retail greengrocers' shops. Amongst the notable businesses trading in the market were Vitacress, Lee Brothers (potato merchants whose signage can still be seen in the market), Manny Sugarman, AW Bourne and Eddy Robbins. JO Sims, the main importer for South African citrus fruit (Outspan), were also located in the market.


Vegetable stall
Stallholders come to trade at the market from different parts of the UK, and traditional European products are also imported and sold. Amongst the produce on sale are fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, meat, game, baked bread and pastries.

The market is a charitable trust administered by a board of volunteer trustees, who have to live in the area.[10]

Borough Market and the surrounding streets have been used as a film location for such features as Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004).[11] As reported by the London Evening Standard, the market is available to hire for private events. From 1860, the railway operating companies desired to extend services from London Bridge station into new stations at Cannon Street and Blackfriars in the City and link to the West End at Charing Cross Station. This required a viaduct, but legally, it was impossible by the 1756 Borough Market Act for the Trustees to alienate their property. The compromise was that only a flying leasehold was given to the railway company for the permanent way, but only for as long as a railway operates on it. The Market continues to trade underneath the arches of the viaduct. Each time there is a railway expansion requiring widening of the viaduct, the Trustees receive a full compensation payment. The last major such expansion was the 1901 extended bridge widening; the 21st-century works programme will also make its contribution. These windfalls have assisted in the finances of the market without any loss of amenity to it. A new viaduct was erected above the market and a bridge across Borough High Street completed in 2014.


First span of the new Borough Market viaduct at Stoney Street
As part of the Thameslink Programme, a large number of listed buildings in the Borough Market area have been altered or demolished,[13] affecting the historic fabric of the area. This includes parts of the market itself and much of the area appearing in the aforementioned films. This was unpopular locally and became a contentious issue in the resulting public inquiry, which resulted in delays to the project. Eventually, the inquiry inspector was satisfied with the plans to restore as much of the market and surrounding area as possible. The overriding need to remove a major bottleneck in the national rail network and improve transport options over a large portion of London meant that he accepted that some damage to the fabric of the market and surrounding area was unavoidable in order for the scheme to achieve its objectives. Disruption to the market activities was kept to a minimum.",Food

371,dJ9BlK6_0,TOP 6 THINGS TO DO IN NEW YORK CITY (On a Budget),"Want to visit NYC and not spend all your money? I've put together my top 6 list of things to do in New York City without blowing your budget.

Have any other suggestions for top things to do in New York City? Let me know in the comments below! I'm also taking suggestions for other cities to do a Top 6 Things to Do on a Budget Travel Guides for, so let me know where you want me to go next!

6) Stay Near Public Transit
You'll save a lot of money by staying at a hotel or Airbnb near a subway or bus line. Public transportation in New York City is some of the best I've come across while traveling, so pretty much any stop on your journey is just a subway ride away.

5) Eat Some of New York's Best Street Food
From the Halal Guys to Wafels and Dinges, I think New York street food is some of the best eats in America, and most meals will only cost you a few bucks.

4) Get Discount Broadway Tickets
There are many ways to save money on Broadway tickets. You can visit a TKTS booth to see shows at up to 50% off, or you can go to the lottery and get cheap seats to almost any show.

3) See an Improv or Comedy Show
There are comedy shows happening all over New York City, and most are seriously cheap to get into. Take your friends for a night out and save money while laughing your butts off!

2) Visit a Museum
Whether it's the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, or the American Museum of Natural History, most museums are free to explore with a suggested donation. Since you can spend hours in each of them, this is a great thing to do if your budget is tight.

1) The Highline and Other Sightseeing
Many people forget that one of the best things to do in New York City is sight see. And most iconic landmarks like the Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, Times Square, and the 9/11 Memorial are totally free to explore!",Food
372,rOAbYFdNQE,"The Ultimate DUBAI FOOD TOUR - Street Food and Emirati Cuisine in Dubai, UAE!","Check out this amazing food in Dubai, UAE!
Peyman’s Channel► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...
Subscribe for 2 new videos per week► 

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (). He’s from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman’s home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it’s a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it’s a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that’s traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it’s awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman’s house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

►T-shirts and caps available now: 

Lao Street Food Tour in Vientiane, Laos - Laos is an amazing country for food lovers, and there’s no better way to start sampling street food than to visit a local  market in Vientiane.

Khua Din Market - This is one of the most bustling morning markets in Vientiane. You’ll discover an ocean of fresh ingredients available in the parking lot before 8 am. But for cooked food, I found some of the best stalls in the tented section at the back of the market - there you’ll find a  few stalls serving all  things Lao food - a place to have a Lao sticky rice feast.

Sausage - 5,000 LAK ($0.60) -  First at the market we stopped for a quick Luang Prabang sausage, known as sai oua. They are so good, the beef in my opinion was tastier than the beef.

For our sticky rice Lao feast throwdown, we ordered a bunch of different dishes and all ate them  together. We had some stews, some jaew, sticky rice, a few grilled items, and the highlight for me was a stuffed fish. Total price - 117,000 LAK ($14.00)

Sandwich - 5,000 LAK ($0.60) - On the outside of Khua Din Market in Vientiane you’ll find a few stalls selling khao gee pate, the Laos version of French baguette sandwiches with pate and toppings. They are not the best quality, but for 5,000 kip, they are a bargain and really do taste pretty good.

Evening Cooked Food Market - For this Vientiane street food tour, in the evening we headed to Ban Anou Night Market, a peaceful evening market where you’ll find a good selection of Lao food. 

Khao Piak Sen - First we had a bowl of khao piak sen. Total price - 15,000 LAK ($1.80)

Next we had some stew dishes, and an order of green papaya salad, all of which were delicious. Total price - 65,000 LAK ($7.78)

Finally to end this Lao street food tour of Vientiane, Joel and I enjoyed some wonderful dried beef. Price - 10,000 LAK ($1.20)

Thank you for watching this Lao street food tour!

Mike and I decided to go on a Thai street food noodles tour, where we tried 5 different types of Thai street food noodle dishes in one day. Mike was in Bangkok visiting from New York, and we got along very well - both of us are food lovers, and both of us are a little obsessed with spice.
 
Here are the restaurants where we ate in the Thai street food noodle tour of Bangkok.
 
1. Wattana Panich (วัฒนาพานิช) - This place is legendary for serving braised beef noodles, and most importantly for their giant everlasting cauldron of simmering meat that never stops. Their classic bowl of beef noodles is a little expensive due to the area and fame, but it’s so good. If you’re more adventurous you can also try their Soup Number 5, and the goat soup which is outstanding.
 
Kuay teow neua tukyang (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเนื้อทุกอย่าง beef noodles with everything)
Soup number 5 (ตัวเดียวอันเดียวแพะ bull penis soup)
Sup peh (ซุปแพะ braised goat soup)
Total price - 765 THB ($22.01)
 
2. Nay Lao Radna Yodpak (นายเหลา ราดหน้ายอดผัก) - At this little restaurant you’ll find one of the best versions of Thai pad see ew in all of Bangkok. It’s smoky, full of flavor, and the egg makes it incredible. 
 
Pad see ew sen yai (ผัดซีอิ๊วเส้นใหญ่)
Pad see ew sen mee paem kai jeow (ผัดซีอิ๊วเส้นหมี่เพิ่มไข่เจียว)
Sen yai radna (เส้นใหญ่ราดหน้า)
5 bowls of noodles - 275 THB ($7.91)
 
3. Kuay Teow Reua Khon Mee Sen (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเรือคนมีเส้น) - Boat noodles are probably one of the most locally popular Thai street food noodle of choice in Bangkok. We went to a place that’s a little far out, but it was pretty good. There are also many places to eat boat noodles within Bangkok.
 
Kuay teow reua nam tok moo (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเรือน้ำตกหมู)
แคปหมู
Price - 10 THB ($0.29) per bowl
 
4. Uan Bamee Giew Guangdong (อ้วน บะหมี่เกี๊ยว (กวางตุ้ง) - For years now, this has been one of my personal favorite Thai street food stalls in Bangkok for Thai Chinese egg noodles.
 
Bamee giew moo daeng haeng (บะหมี่เกี๊ยวหมูแดงแห้ง)
Price - 40 THB ($1.15) per bowl 
 
5. Pad Thai Je Tim (ผัดไทยเจ๊ติ๋ม) - To be honest, we sort of just ran out of time, and needed to take the baby home to sleep, so we weren’t able to eat a better version of Pad Thai. This place was pretty average, but it finished off our 5 Thai noodles tour of Bangkok. For a better Pad Thai, I'd recommend: 
 
Pad Thai goong sod (ผัดไทยกุ้งสด)
Pad Thai haw kai (ผัดไทยห่อไข่)
Total price - 95 THB ($2.73)
 
Thank you for watching, hope you enjoyed this Thai street food noodles tour of Bangkok!

397,PZCo_fSmlL,The Best Fried Chicken in NYC || 5 Buck Lunch,"NYC is arguably one of the most romantic cities in the world, but sometimes seeing couples in love just makes us want to eat our feelings. And no one understands that more than host Cody Reiss. In a quest to find the best comfort food in the city for 5 bucks or less, he takes us to Charles Pan Fried Chicken. Located in Harlem, this neighborhood gem serves up delicious soul-healing food for an affordable price. That is, after all, why Thrillist is your go-to, be-all and end-all for food recommendations. You know the rules: We’ve only got $5, so we need to make every penny count... and we’ve definitely got you covered. 

Thrillist is bringing back its popular cheap-eats show, but bigger and better than ever with three new hosts. Every week, we’ll explore all the best places to eat (that actually taste good) for under $5, and not a penny more. This season, we’re taking it beyond just New York City and traveling to Washington, DC and the San Francisco Bay to show you where to get the best bang for your buck. So if you need a break from the expensive, the chains, or you’re just looking for new places to try in your city, this is the show for you. Welcome to “5 Buck Lunch.”

Cody Reiss is a Brooklyn-based food writer, comedian, and actor making video and written projects at the intersection of food and comedy. Over the past decade, he has traveled to over 35 countries and all over the US, working as a cook, farmer, cheese maker, and cheese monger. He’s tried over 400 cheeses and his favorite fruit is the fig.

Hi! We grew up on opposite ends of the United States in Texas and Ohio. Later in college, we met and got married in August of 2016. As poor newly weds and recent college grads, we moved to New York City to begin what we thought would be our long careers in finance. Only one year later, after accumulating over 2 million miles and points through ""travel hacking"", we booked round-the-world business class tickets to over 40 countries for free. We quit our jobs, sold everything we owned, and began this once-in-a-lifetime adventure on August 27, 2018. Chad has always loved creating home videos to hold onto the memories we share while traveling, so we started this YouTube channel as a place to share our adventures with friends and family. We hope you'll join our journey to exciting countries and experiences around the world!",Food
399,DD4eNeh8,10 Hours of Walking in NYC as Kim Jong Un,"10 Hours of Walking in NYC as Kim Jong Un.  Make sure you SUBSCRIBE and join the QSquad ARMY!  
http://bit.ly/qsquad  
As a follow up to my 10 hours of walking in NYC wearing a romper, I decided to see how New Yorkers would react to seeing Kim Jong Un walking around. We walked through 3 neighborhoods:  Harlem, Wall Street, and Koreatown.  New York definitely took notice.  To be honest, I was quite nervous to see how New York would react to this Kim Jong-Un social experiment.  I was surprised as to the positive reception he received.  There was a lot of comedy, a little bit of catcalling and only a tiny bit of street harassment.   In a strange way, it gives me hope that differences can be resolved between all the countries and that we can find a way to co-exist as well as find a way to help the people of North Korea.

Then we continued on to an ancient and well preserved Muslim village, and finally had an ethnic dinner back in Dali new town.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour (it’s not sponsored), but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

The first bowl of noodles was spectacular, a seperate bowl of noodles and a dipping soup of chili oil and pork. It was the perfect way to start a cold day in Yunnan, China.
Price - 11 RMB ($1.67) per bowl

Next we tried a Chinese street food snack that’s popular in Yunnan.  A rice sheet is first grilled, then on went some pickles, peanuts, and a bunch of spices, and finally a Chinese donut was filled on the inside.
Price - 1 RMB ($0.15)

Entire bowl one noodle - Yes, the entire bowl of noodle was actually just one single noodle. It was one of the most fascinating to watch bowls ever. There’s a pan of coiled dough, which she expertly adds and stretches out as she boils it. You noodle gets cooked then topped with some vegetables and pork. It’s amazing to watch being made, and tastes delicious too.
Price -  8 RMB ($1.21)

Donglianhua (东莲花) Village - This is a well preserved ancient Muslim village, and Luxi brought us to a friend who is an outstanding cook with a gorgeous Chinese courtyard. She cooked one of the most amazing Halal beef salads I’ve ever had, plus Chinese Muslim noodles. Watching her cook everything from scratch and then eating in the courtyard environment was truly spectacular.
Xi Lian Shan (喜莲膳)
Total price - 120 RMB ($18.18)

Jingpo Yan Han Ren Jia (景颇岩罕人家) - Finally for dinner we drove back to Dali new town and ate dinner at a Jingpo restaurant, which is food from the border near Myanmar. The food was ate was not Chinese food like you would normally think, but more similar to Thai / Burmese or with Southeast Asian spices and flavors. It was an amazing meal to finish a fantastic Chinese street food tour day.
Total price - 200 RMB ($30.30)

This is Day 2 of our Chinese Food in Yunnan tour. Watch the full series here:

414,815lSYphl,Japanese Food Tour with Frank Pinello and Sakura Yagi | Sean in the Wild,"As the host of Viceland's ""The Pizza Show,"" Frank Pinello eats, breaths, and sleeps slices. But what you might not know about Frank is that he's also one of NYC's biggest Japanese food obsessives. On a rare day off from pizza and chicken wings, Sean Evans decides to take his friend on a tour of Manhattan's Little Tokyo—a stretch of the East Village that's home to some of the city's most sought-after Japanese cuisine. With the help of TIC restaurant group's Sakura Yagi, Sean and Frank slurp soba, binge on Japanese street food, and slice open some omurice.

Omdat we zo'n tof programma hadden samengesteld besloot ik voor de verandering een keer te vloggen. Vandaag is vlog 6 aan de beurt: we doen een foodcart tour in het Financial District en proeven heel veel Amerikaans streetfood.

Veelgestelde vragen:
1. Waar koop jij je chocolate chips?
Ik koop ze altijd bij de HANOS (groothandel) maar Jumbo en Jamin hebben ze ook. Je kunt ook een reep chocolade gebruiken en deze in stukken snijden.

2. Kan ik de bakpoeder ook weglaten?
Nee, dat gaat niet zo makkelijk. Wel kun je bloem + bakpoeder vervangen door zelfrijzend bakmeel.

3. Kan ik de roomboter ook vervangen door margarine?
Als jij liever geen lactose en/of dierlijke producten eet dan kun je de roomboter vervangen voor margarine.

4. Kun je ook pure, melk of witte chocolade gebruiken?
Ja, chocolade is in principe altijd te vervangen door de kleur/smaak die jij het lekkerst vindt.

5. Kun je in plaats van vanille-aroma ook iets anders gebruiken?
Vanille-aroma is te vervangen door verse vanille, vanille-extract of vanillesuiker. Andersom geldt dit voor de andere producten ook. Je kunt het 9/10 keer ook helemaal weglaten.

6. Zijn andere merken dan degene die jij gebruikt ook goed?
Het maakt mij echt niet uit of je boodschappen doet bij de Aldi, Lidl, Albert Heijn of uitsluitend bij speciaalzaken. Gebruik gewoon je verstand. Als ik 'naturel roomkaas' gebruik in een recept dan hoef je uiteraard niet per se Philadelphia te gebruiken maar kun je ook uit de voeten met het huismerk van Aldi. 

7. Kun je X vervangen door Y of ik lust geen....
Ik ga er vanuit dat als je een intolerantie hebt voor het een of het ander of een bepaald ingrediënt niet lust, je zelf wel een beetje weet waar je dat specifieke ingrediënt voor kunt vervangen. Zo vervangt Agar Agar gelatine en kun je groenten makkelijke weglaten of vervangen voor een andere groenten. Nog steeds lastig? Google it!

The best pupusas I’ve had, in El Salvador or in the States, have usually been in some kind of covered outdoor setting: on a someone’s patio listening to rain tapping on a corrugated tin awning, or sitting at a long table with strangers, picnic-style, under a canopy or other kind of pavilion-like structure. I’m not sure why that is. This is what makes eating pupusas at Backyard Pupusas, a modest set-up in South L.A., the magically informal experience it is.

421,gAdCjMhoZ,"LONDON STREET FOOD, BURGER, DOUGNUTS, BACON, SAUSAGES, PASTA","LONDON STREET FOOD, BURGER, DOUGNUTS, BACON, SAUSAGES, PASTA, CAMDEN MARKET, The Camden markets are a number of adjoining large retail markets in Camden Town near the Hampstead Road Lock of the Regent's Canal (popularly referred to as Camden Lock), often collectively named ""Camden Market"" or ""Camden Lock"". Among products sold on the stalls are crafts, clothing, bric-a-brac, and fast food. It is the fourth-most popular visitor attraction in London, attracting approximately 250,000 people each week.[1]

A small local foodstuffs market has operated in Inverness Street in Camden Town since the beginning of the 20th century. From 1974 a small weekly crafts market that operated every Sunday near Camden Lock developed into a large complex of markets.[2] The markets, originally temporary stalls only, extended to a mixture of stalls and fixed premises. The traditional Inverness Street market started losing stalls once local supermarkets opened; by mid-2013 all the original stalls had gone, being replaced by stalls similar to those of the other markets, including fast food but not produce.

The markets originally operated on Sundays only, which continues to be the main trading day. Opening later extended to Saturdays for most of the market. A number of traders, mainly those in fixed premises, operate throughout the week, although the weekend remains the peak period.

In 2014, Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi started buying property in the Camden Market area.[3] By March 2015, having purchased the four most important of the six sections of the market, he announced plans to invest £300 million in developing the market area by 2018.    Camden Lock Market is situated by the Regent's Canal on a site formerly occupied by warehouses and other premises associated with the canal. By the early 1970s the canal trade had ceased and a northern urban motorway was planned that would cut through the site, making any major permanent redevelopment impossible, and in 1974 a temporary market was established. By 1976, when plans for the motorway were abandoned, the market had become a well known feature of Camden Town. Originally, the Lock was a market for crafts, occupying some outdoor areas by the canal and various existing buildings.

While the range of goods has since widened, with stalls selling books, new and second-hand clothing, and jewellery, the Lock retains its focus as the principal Camden market for crafts. There is a large selection of fast food stalls. In 1991 a three-storey indoor market hall designed by architect John Dickinson was opened on the site of the first outdoor market. In the style of the traditional 19th century industrial architecture and housing in the area, it is built of brick and cast iron. It attracted large numbers of visitors partly due to stalls being open on Sundays, when previous to the Sunday Trading Act 1994, shops were not permitted to operate on Sundays. On 28 February 1993, the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb hidden in a litter bin on Camden High Street near the market, shortly after lunchtime. The bomb injured 11 people.[4][5]

From 2006, a large indoor market hall was constructed in a yard between the Camden Lock Market and the Stables Market that was previously used for open air stalls. In November 2007 a large part of the Stables Market was demolished as part of a long-term redevelopment plan for the area and rebuilt as a year-round permanent market area.

In 2016, Urban Markets Company acquired Camden Lock and paid between £300m and £400m for the one-acre site. The joint venture between the founders of Camden Lock and Millitarne Retail Resorts International, the retail developers, was financed by Brockton Capital, a real estate private equity fund.[6] Camden Lock Market is set to have a £20 million makeover to transform it into a traditional arts and craft centre for Londoners. The Urban Market Company plans to double the enclosed area and increase trading space by 15,000 square feet.",Food

Owners Bill Clark and Libby Willis had a night out in Manhattan with their partners, grabbing drinks at New York City’s oldest gay bar, sampling the food at Chinatown hotspot Lalito, eating an Italian feast at Don Angie’s, and checking in at the Cubbyhole, NYC’s most famous lesbian bar. They ended the night with a layered cake and a riff on nachos.

We decided to set ourselves a challenge to see and do as much as we possibly could, and that gave way to this travel video guide which highlights 50 of the top attractions. In a city like New York this means we barely scratched the surface, but hopefully this video will highlight the cornucopia of possibilities that is the Big Apple.

Most journeys begin at Penn Station or Grand Central, and if you arrive at the later you'll be wowed by the building. The Meatpacking District was once home to markets, slaughterhouses, and packaging plants, but times have changed. Today you'll find a mixture of trendy restaurants, clubs and boutiques. The Village used to be a bohemian neighborhood that drew artists and musicians, but today you're more likely to find upper middle class families living here. Completed in 1883, Brooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States. Williamsburg has become popular given its lower rent prices. University students and young professionals have been flocking to this part of town.
You can walk along the riverfront for a great view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges and the Manhattan skyline. During the summer months, Bryant Park also becomes a popular hangout spot people looking to relax and even work on their tans. The Staten Island Ferry is free of charge and this makes it really popular with visitors who want to catch a glimpse of the Statue of Liberty from a distance. Battery Park is located on the southern tip of Manhattan. Having both lived in South Korea, we were thrilled to come across Manhattan's own Little Korea. Coney Island is all about good old fashioned fun. The Cloisters will make you feel like you've travelled over to Europe. Central Park is massive and there are so many places to visit within its boundaries. We managed to visit Belvedere Castle, the Great Lawn, Shakespeare Garden, The Ramble, The Jackie Onassis Reservoir, the Alice in Wonderland Statue, and we still left feeling like we barely scratched the surface.

And that concludes a look at our very busy week in New York City. I'm still shocked we managed to cover so many attractions, but the great thing about this city is that distances aren't very long and there's always something really cool worth checking out around each corner.

T-shirts and caps: 

CURITIBA, BRAZIL - Curitiba is located in the Paraná state of southern Brazil. It’s a pleasant city, and they known especially for meat. In this video we go on a Brazilian food tour of Curitiba, explore some of the iconic meat dishes of the city, and eat a 5 kilo family sandwich!   

Mercearia Fantinato - Carne de onça (Jaguar meat), known as jaguar meat, yet of course not jaguar at all, this steak tartare (raw minced beef) got its name because of the raw meat breath you’ll have after you eat it. It’s mixed table-side, and it’s delicious.
Price - 53.99 BRL ($13.54)

Costelão do Gaúcho - One of the things that Curitiba is known for, and all of southern Brazil, is meat - and especially the beef ribs are among the prized cut. Costelão do Gaúcho is an amazing restaurant that specializes in beef ribs. The owner is a master, treating each rack of ribs with respect and roasting and smoking them with precision. I loved his table saw method of cutting the ribs. The ribs were outstanding, as was the entire meal with all the side salads and dishes.

4 Beans Coffee Co. - We stopped in for a quick coffee, but that turned into a coffee roasting session, which was fantastic.

Lanchonete da Lombada - Here we go, the mega 5 kg. Lombada sandwich. Lombada means speedbump in Portuguese, because it was formerly a street food stall right in front of the speedbump. It was just insane, huge bun, layers of meat, hot dogs, massive quantities of squeeze cheese. It’s not a food challenge, but a very popular local family meal in Curitiba, Brazil. Total price - 50 BRL ($12.45)

Tio Dog (Uncle Dog) - Probably one of the most iconic of all the Brazilian fast food in Curitiba is TIo Dog, specialising in a number of different sandwiches and hot dogs. We got The Philadelphia, a bun filled with hot dogs, a variety of unknown sauces, and little crunchy chip fries. It’s one of those late night impulse foods - not something I’d eat on a daily basis.

Curitiba was fun, and it was a Brazilian food tour of meat!

This is my first time having brunch in Jakarta Indonesia, and I must say, they sure know how to do their brunch here! The noodle dishes that I ordered for brunch are just incredible, the texture of the noodles are extremely chewy and stretchy, especially mixed with the pieces of the crispy pork! 
All the noodle dishes that I have tried in this video are all extremely chewy, and stretchy, I really can't decide which noodle dish is my favorite!
I'm also really glad that I got to try out the different types of the Indonesian Brunch, from the flavored porky soup to ribs that fall off the bones and let's not forget the fresh seafood.
Overall, I must say all the tasty brunch that I have visited in Jakarta are just simply fantastic!

435,ROsHRd_,American foodies are finally embracing real Chinese food,"Chinese food in America is changing as Chinese-American immigrant identity strengthens and China's global power surges. 

With China’s economic boom, the image of its people has changed—and Chinese cuisine has developed along with it. Today, New York City is seeing a proliferation of upscale Chinese restaurants that prioritize ingredients, ambiance, and authenticity over catering to American palates. 

Earlier waves of Chinese immigrants opened restaurants as a way of getting by; their lower socioeconomic status placed Chinese cuisine at the bottom of what food studies scholars refer to as the “hierarchy of taste.” But the young, upwardly mobile restaurateurs behind these newly-opened eateries are more concerned with self-expression than survival. It’s changing how Chinese food is perceived in America, and ultimately may reshape Americans’ ideas about taste

If you are in New York — is it some of these Chinese restaurants we highlight; Ho Foods (East Village, NYC), Hunan Slurp (East Village, NYC), Spicy Village (Chinatown, LES, NYC), Le Sia (East Village, NYC), The Tang (East Village, NYC)

But he also boasts a wealth of knowledge about Indonesian food. Hoping to get a grasp on the country's cuisine, Sean Evans brings the Jakarta native to Bali Kitchen—a new destination for fast-casual Indonesian food in NYC. From rendang and nasi goreng, to the various spice levels found in sambal, Rich Chigga breaks down the Indonesian food commandments once and for all. But whatever you do, just don't call him a hot dog.

453,P3ytDvxvl8,Chinatown in Flushing is NYC’s Dumpling Capital || Food/Groups,"Ten miles east of New York City's ""original"" Chinatown in Downtown Manhattan lies one of the fastest-growing Asian-American neighborhoods in the country: Flushing, Queens.

Mandarin-speaking Chinese immigrants dominate the scene here on the outskirts of this outer borough, so it's become a must-hit food mecca for less-touristy tastes of Chinese-American staples. Take dumplings. Flushing has some of the city's very finest examples, and together they form a crucial part of the culinary and social fabric of ""Chinese Manhattan.""

But you can't talk about Flushing and dumplings without talking to the Queen of Dumplings herself: Helen You. So we caught up with her at Dumpling Galaxy (her second Flushing dumpling house, opened after the runaway success of her still-fantastic Tianjin Dumpling House in Golden Mall) to get her take on what these tasty, doughy little orbs of joy mean to the neighborhood.

ABOUT US : 
We’re Trina & Pierre. American girl meets French guy in Nigeria. Flash forward 6 years later, and we’ve call Lagos, Istanbul, Paris, and New York City our home. We were meant to settle down in the States but somewhere along the line we got caught up in this wonderful idea that we could live anywhere in the world. That we could do what we love, find passion, and secure our futures all at the same time. I can’t tell you if this dream will become a reality, but we are sure as hell going to try. To all you dreamers out there, we’re ready to dream with you and make some great things happen along the way.

For dinner I ate across the street from the Oriental Residence Bangkok and ate some food on a stick, papaya salad and some pork with chillies. 

I love eating THAI street food! Have you been to Bangkok? What are your favorite Thai Street Foods?

485,5Xp_dWzNdSA,Luke's Lobster New York Maine Lobster Roll! by HourPhilippines.com,"Luke's Lobster Upper West Side New York Lobster Roll!  Luke’s Lobster is a Maine-bred seafood shack committed to serving simple dishes that highlight superior ingredients, sourced from sustainable fisheries and traceable back to the very harbor where their seafood was caught.  It was started in the East Village in 2009 by Maine native Luke Holden who was a one time lobsterman and now has a mission to take the lobster roll mass market with numerous locations across the United States.   The price point here is only $17 for a lobster roll which would usually cost at least $30 at other sit down restaurants.   They pair their seafood with chowders and bisques, Maine-style sides, local desserts, natural sodas, and local award winning microbrews.

They serve lobster, crab and shrimp rolls Maine-style - split-top buns are buttered and toasted, just barely, with a smear of mayonnaise. They are then stuffed with a generous quarter pound of seafood and arrive with a glossy sheen of lemon infused butter and dazzle of celery salt.   Highly recommended are their Lobster Roll and Lobster Bisque best paired with Allegash White Beer or their Maine Root Blue Berry Soda.  Take note they also offer Happy Hour from 4pm-7pm daily up to 50% off.

Bangkok is one of the best cities in the world for street food, and in Thai extreme Thai street food tour, I met up with my friends Khun Tan () and Khun Tape (), who are food lovers and Thai food experts.

We went on an ultimate night street food tour, starting with a tuk-tuk, which I didn’t even know we were going to do from the beginning. It was a thrilling night, so much Thai food, and so much fun.

Later in the night we also met up with Chef Ton from Le Du:  when we ate the extreme Mama instant noodles at Jay Oh.

Here are all the restaurants we ate at:

Sawang (ร้านสว่างบะหมี่ ก้ามปู) - To begin the night, we ate at Sawang (ร้านสว่างบะหมี่ ก้ามปู), a legendary restaurant in Bangkok for egg noodles and crab. You can also order their pork noodles which are delicious. I ordered ba mee kam boo, egg noodles with crab claw and the biggest size of the claw. A bit expensive, but so good - 400 THB Google map: 

Lim Lao Ngow Fish Ball Noodle (ลิ้มเหล่าโหงว (สาขาเยาวราช) - Known for their fresh fish balls Lim Lao Ngow Fish Ball Noodle (ลิ้มเหล่าโหงว (สาขาเยาวราช) is a street food stall in Bangkok’s Chinatown. Their fishballs are delicious and bouncy. Google map: 

Somsak Pu Ob (สมศักดิ์ปูอบ กุ้งอบวุ้นเส้น) - One of my favorite street food stalls in Bangkok is Somsak Pu Ob (สมศักดิ์ปูอบ กุ้งอบวุ้นเส้น), and they specialize in mung bean noodles cooked in a pan with pork fat, spices like Sichuan pepper and black pepper, and either crab or shrimp. It’s incredibly taste especially with seafood sauce. Google map: 

Jay Hong Worachak (ร้าน เจ้ฮ้งก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่วรจักร) - One of the highlights of this Thai street food tour of Bangkok was eating kuay teow khua gai at Jay Hong Worachak (ร้าน เจ้ฮ้งก๋วยเตี๋ยวคั่วไก่วรจักร), a back alley restaurant serving the smokiest fire noodles in Bangkok. Google map: 

Jay Oh (ร้านเจ๊โอว) - Probably the most well known late night Bangkok street food restaurant in the city is Jay Oh (ร้านเจ๊โอว), a university spot that serves an array of tasty greasy dishes. Their glorified Thai instant noodles are pretty crazy, and pretty tasty. Google map: 

Iam Pochana (เอี่ยมโภชนา) - Finally, to end this Thai street food tour in Bangkok we went to Iam Pochana (เอี่ยมโภชนา) to end with a simmering beef hot pot. Google map: 

That wraps up this extreme late night street food tour of Bangkok. Hope you enjoyed it and keep enjoying Thai food!

KARACHI, Sindh, Pakistan

From the mountains on Hunza Valley, we flew to Karachi, on the Arabian sea, and a world of difference from the mountains. I was happy to be in Karachi to discover the amazing street food, and it didn’t let us down!

Here are the things we ate on this ultimate Pakistani street food tour of Karachi, Pakistan:

Javed Nihari - I’ve probably said this a few times, but there’s no meatier breakfast (maybe in the world) than nihari, a meat stew that’s often paired with plenty of desi ghee and either brains of bone-marrow. It’s truly a breakfast of meat loving champions, but it is filling and heavy, and so good. Javed Nihari is one of the best places in Karachi to eat nihari.
Total price - 1,150 PKR ($8.42)

Burns Road - We continued on to Burns Road, one of the legendary street food streets in Karachi. It was a Sunday morning and there were elections happening, so Burns road wasn’t actually that busy. But we did find a few delicious things to try.

Arabian paratha - The Arabian paratha, or mataba, or any other names it has across Asia is a stuffed roti. In this case he filled it with chicken and spices and egg before wrapping it up and shallow frying it. It was delicious.
Price - 120 PKR ($0.88)

Matka kulfi - Also on Burns Road is a maka kulfi shop where they sell Pakistani ice cream in little clay cups. The pistachio and saffron were the best.
Price - 50 PKR ($0.37) each

Rabri - I’m not huge on sweets, but on Burns Road we need to try rabri.
Price - 200 PKR ($0.88)

Chicken biryani - Just randomly walking around we decided to try our first plate of Karachi biryani - and Karachi is known for their biryani. It was simple, but very good, with a wonderful flavor of dried lime, and it was just a very cool spot.
Price - 80 PRK ($0.59)

Liaquatabad - We continued this Pakistani street food tour of Karachi in Liaquatabad a busy market area, full of street food.

Qadri Nalli Biryani - This was the highlight of the food tour, if not one of the best dishes of my entire trip to Pakistan. Nalli biryani, Pakistani bone marrow biryani is one of the best things ever.
Price - They wouldn’t charge us

Salad - His ninja chopping skills brought me in and there was no way I couldn’t stop to eat his salad. Amazing!
Price - 40 PKR ($0.28)

MashAllah Fish Katakat - The next meal we had was MashAllah Fish Katakat, and a dish called katakat. Most of the time its prepared with organs, but this was with fish, and it was again one of the best dishes I ate in Pakistan. An amazing combination of fish, spices, and chutney.

Landhi Dairy Colony - Next we headed to the biggest buffalo colony in Asia, maybe the world. Over 700,000 - 800,000 cattle and livestock live within this area that is within Karachi, Pakistan. It was fascinating to visit and drink the freshest buffalo milk possible.

Dua Restaurant - Finally for dinner we finished this Karachi street food tour at Dua Restaurant, a huge restaurant serving grilled meat and karahis. The prawns karahi was the highlight for me.
Total price - 4,840 PKR ($35.45)

It was an amazing day of street food in Karachi, Pakistan!

In this Chinese Street Food tour video, I'm going to take you on a food street journey to many delicious, mouthwatering street food places around Beijing, AKA Peking, in Northern China. If you're thinking about traveling to China for the street food, make sure to come visit Beijing. You can enjoy unique Chinese street foods hidden in Beijing's Hutong Alleyways and try some classic Chinese cuisine favorites like Peking duck AKA Beijing duck, Jian bing ( 煎饼) AKA Chinese crepes, and a ton of other hidden specialties. 
 In the past 3 years, I've shot and eaten street food around China, including locations like Chengdu, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Wuhan, Leshan, Shanghai, and Xinjiang's Silk Road. So far, the street food in each of these locations has been the best street food around the world!
 
Chinese cuisine is so fantastic, it would really take a lifetime to eat all of it. I consider myself super lucky and fortunate to be able to live in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, eating Sichuan food and sampling food across the whole country whenever I get the chance. I've decided to stay living in China for another year or two or even more, shooting delicious street food in china for you and across asia as well!

Here are the addresses and locations and restaurant names for the Chinese street food I had in this Beijing travel video. Most locations were deep in Beijing's Hutong alleyways!

Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours:  for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn’t eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there’s a version that’s comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. 

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I’ve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ½ chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven’t already, watch the full series here:

Welcome to the best tacos in the world - the ultimate guide to Mexican street food tacos in Mexico City!

I met up with Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha (), he’s from Mexico City, he makes videos about street food as well. And he took me to his favorite tacos in all of Mexico City. We each ate the most tacos in one single day that we’d ever eaten in our lives, and it was the greatest taco day of my life!

Here are all the places we ate in this video:

Tacos Joven - They are known for their tacos de canasta, which are basket tacos, famous in Mexico City. They are served from a basket, and they keep hot the entire day as they are served. The highlight here was the chicharrón taco with chicharrón salsa.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria El Abanico - This is Lalo’s favorite restaurant in Mexico City for carnitas, the wildly popular braised pork taco. The entire rib in my taco was the highlight, so tender and flavorful.
Price - 20 MXN ($1.08) per taco

El Pescadito de Sonora - Originating from Hermosillo in Sonora, El Pescadito serves Mexican seafood tacos, especially shrimp or marlin tacos. Their tacototo is a taco that will change your life. This was as good as food gets for me.
Price - 35 MXN ($1.89) per taco

Tacos Charly - When it comes to Mexican street food, suadero is one of the greatest, a massive pan of slow braising beef in its juices. When you order your tacos, they slice up the meat, dip your tortilla in the fat, and you eat it with onions, cilantro, and salsa - pure meat heaven.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria Los Güeros - Tacos de tripa, intestines, are very popular in Mexico City as well. They may not be the most pretty tacos, but they are immensely flavorful and have all sorts of different textures going on in your mouth.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Tacos Los Juanes - This is a great Mexican street food restaurant in Mexico City that serves all sorts of different tacos. We came for the tacos de cabeza and tacos de lengua, both of which were fantastic
Price - 10 MXN ($0.54) per taco

El Vilsito - For Mexican street food in Mexico City, the ultimate taco, the most loved by everyone is no doubt, Al Pastor. Cooked in the vertical spit, a technique brought over from Lebanese immigrants, Al Pastor is usually made with marinated pork that’s juicy and flavorful it might make you weep tears of joy. Lalo and I ordered, not just your ordinary tacos de al pastor, but the King of all tacos, the Gringa!
Price - 50 MXN ($2.70) each

Thanks again to Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha: 

This was the greatest taco day of my life. Thank you for watching!

Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She’s a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she’s incredible. Check out her Instagram () and YouTube (). 

Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here’s all the amazing food we ate:

Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What’s key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!
Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)

Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.
Coconut toffee
Tigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)
Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)

Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.
Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)

This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra. Many thanks to Jay!

►T-shirts and caps available now: 

Talad Rot Fai Ratchada (ตลาดรถไฟรัชดา) - Also known as the train market, is one of the most popular night markets in Bangkok. It’s especially popular on the weekend when a younger crowd flocks to the market to eat the latest Thai street food trends, and hang out with friends.

The train market has in recent months become famous for its giant food - you’ll find a number of giant Thai dishes to try like egg noodles, pork bone soup, and now the massive lobster tom yum - possibly the world’s biggest bowl of tom yum?

Diaw Goong Rot Fai Restaurant (เตี๋ยวกุ้งรถไฟ) - This is the name of the restaurant, and when we ordered they started preparing the lobster.

Giant Lobster Tom Yum (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวต้มยำโครตกุ้งมังกรยักษ์) - They serve it in a basin, like a mini bathtub, not even a bowl. And it’s HUGE. They layer in the fish, squid, mussels, shrimp, and finally a giant lobster goes on top, followed by all the tom yum soup broth. Honestly, the seafood isn’t the freshest or best quality, but you don’t really go to eat a bathtub of seafood for the quality - you go for the insaneness of it.
Price - 2,800 THB ($89.27)

Here are the other Thai street foods we tried on this tour:

Seafood griddle cakes (ขนมครกทะเล)
Price - 60 THB ($1.91)

Green mango crab egg salad (ยำมะม่วงไข่ปูทะเล)
Price - 150 THB ($4.78)

499,24SNu1e0,Tokyo Street Food Market Experience | Ameyoko ★ ONLY in JAPAN,"Tokyo's Ameyoko Market is the city's street food paradise. There is no debate. The market street runs for 400 meters along the Yamanote Line from Okachimachi to Ueno Station. There are hundreds of shops selling all kinds of delicious foods but its the market's past that makes it unique. 

▶︎ HISTORY
Ameyoko was Tokyo's black market during the US Occupation between 1945 and 1952, a place where you could get expensive and highly regulated goods like sugar.

▶︎ The ""Ame"" in Ameyoko means CANDY in Japanese. 
But ""ame"" also stands for ""AMErica"" since the market sold so many good broght in by US Servicemen during the occupation. You can still see sun glasses, watches, and Zippo lighters sold on the street to this day. 

The market has changed a lot over the last 75 years. 
After being a black market, it became home to Tohoku's seafood in the 1950s since nearby Ueno is the city's gate to the north of the country. In the 1970s and 80s, immigrants from abroad made their homes in the area and there is a growing variety of foods. With more tourists flooding the market, stands are converting from shops to restaurants at night, tables spilling into the streets. 

And then there is STREET FOOD galore! 
In this episode:
★ Kaisendon (Tokimakidon) 750 Yen 
★ Takoyaki 200 yen for 4
★ Potato-Rella Cheese Stick 480 yen
★ Kakigori (Kyoto Uji Kinji Milk) 400 yen/

Congratulations to Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) who recently was awarded a Michelin Star!

Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) is no doubt one of the most legendary Thai street food restaurants in Bangkok - some people are loyal fans, others say that it’s overpriced. It’s a Thai restaurants in Bangkok that I had been wanting to eat at for a long time, but never got around to it - partly because it is so expensive. So finally one day for lunch, Ying and I drove over to central Bangkok to try Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) for the first time.

But really quickly, about the name....

In Thai, Jay (เจ๊) means a Chinese Aunty and Fai (ไฝ) means a mole, yes a mole. What I can tell you first about the restaurant is that the owner is absolutely awesome. She wears ski goggles and a snow cap while she’s cooking, and she cooks over huge fire charcoal, fanning the flame as she expertly cooks. She’s also quite a character, and she loves to chat - so while I was filming she shared all about herself, and how her method of cooking her legendary Thai crab omelet ensures that it doesn’t soak up very much oil. It’s indeed the most amazing omelet you might ever see in your life.

Crab omelet (ไข่เจียวปู) - You can either order the 800 THB or the 1000 THB crab omelet, I went with the 1000 THB. It’s huge, but only uses 2 eggs, but it’s packed with shell less crab nuggets. The omelet is cooked burrito style, and  it’s massive. It’s a must order when you eat at Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ).

Drunken noodles (เส้นใหญ่ผัดขี้เมาทะเล) - Her version of Thai drunken noodles (pad kee mao sen ya) is the dish I would come back for over and over again. Again, it’s not  cheap,  but the quality of seafood and the seasoning that she uses is superb. The balance of flavor will blow your mind - it’s really the best plate of Thai drunken noodles I’ve had in Bangkok.

Tom yum goong (ต้มยำกุ้ง) - For our final dish we tried Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) tom yum  goong. Again, massive prawns and seafood were used, and she cooked it over charcoal. It was awesomely delicious, sour, and flavorful.

Conclusion:
Eating at Thai street food restaurants like this can be all about expectations. You have to go in knowing the prices are very high and you’re going to spend way more money than going to any other corner Thai street food restaurant. That being said, it’s a one-of-a-kind historical culinary legend of a restaurant in Bangkok. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience eat at Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ),  and it was an honor to stand there and talk with Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ), and then eat her cooking.

Total price - 2,370 THB ($72.32)

When you arrive, you instantly know you are in a new street food world, and that you can taste some of the best street food around the world in 2017!

I’ve been searching for the best street food in China for a long time, and have to say that when it comes to Chinese street food, some is good, some is bad, but in Xinjiang, most of the stuff we tried was fantastic! The meat and the sloppy dumplings were out of this world! You’ll fall in love watching the delicious street food in this street food video, because we came specifically to try the best street food in China, as we make our way west along the Silk Road to the farthest part of western China. Coming here is a whole new world of Chinese cuisine. Eating Chinese food in Xinjiang is definitely one of the best street food experiences I’ve had!

We made our way to Kuqa from Chengdu. We first took the train to Xining and enjoyed the Hui Chinese muslim Chinese street food and then took the train to Turpan and onwards to Kuqa, our final destination being Kashgar. The dishes we have been eating so far really reminds me of central asian street food. From the super flavor packed hand pulled noodles, to the roast deep tandoori baozi, it’s a great destination for food.

So far I’ve eaten street food in Chengdu, street food in Hong Kong, street food in Guangzhou, Street food in Shanghai, and street food all around Asia, but something as simple as the street food here in Xinjiang (Kuqa) really impressed me!

All the street food we tried, in particular the hand pulled noodles, which tasted like spaghetti, was fantastic! Even the bbq kebabs were amazing as well. The locals here speak Uighur and a little Chinese, so I got by communicating with them in Chinese, but would be better if I picked up some Uighur. Overall, our experience eating in Kuqa, Xinjiang was amazing!

Here are the locations in this street food video:

1) Roast Tandoori Nang Bread -
2) Sunday Market (Featuring Hand pulled noodles, pumpkin baozi, and roast tandoori baozi)-
3) Huge meat nirvana feast -

504,1fVwoquZuU4,Dubai Food - RARE Camel Platter - WHOLE Camel w/ Rice + Eggs - Traditional Emirati Cuisine in UAE!,"Dubai Food is incredibly delicious! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We visited Dubai in the UAE to try some traditional Emirati Cuisine, and joined up with our friend Peyman to eat a whole camel platter with rice and eggs!

►Check out Peyman's Channel Here: 

This is a traditional Emirati meal that is usually reserved for special occasions or very exclusive guests. It's not a normal Dubai Street Food, but that's why it's so good. It is an extremely rare Arab food nowadays! You have to be incredibly lucky to experience this whole camel platter! This is definitely one of the must try foods in Dubai! It is a traditional Emirati food and is one of the best things to do in Dubai. Camel meat is something that may be sensitive to some viewers, so make sure you're comfortable with watching the camel cooking! The chefs who prepared the camel recipe were originally from the South of India in Kerala, but have been living in Dubai for over 20 years.

If you're thinking of traveling to Dubai for a food trip, you can't go wrong, there is so much delicious Emirati cuisine and amazing street food to try! I must admit, most of the food is in Dubai restaurants that are clean and quiet, but that is part of the charm of Dubai.

First, Peyman and I checked out the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and then made our way to the one and only Camel Restaurant, address below:

Entire Camel Platter in Dubai: Zaman Awal Restaurant
Address: Al Boom Village, Dubai, UAE, United Arab Emirates

If you're wondering if you should eat street food in Dubai or go for regular restaurants in Dubai, I recommend mixing it up and going for both. In this food video, we are solely visiting one of the best restaurants in dubai for the whole camel plate.

Sadly, there was a recent fire in the outer Tsukiji Market at a legendary ramen shop. Luckily no one has been reported injured from the fire, but it is very sad to see some legendary Japanese street food stalls completely destroyed.

Ok, now back to the information from this Japanese street food tour of Tsukiji Market in Tokyo! 

If you’re a food lover, there’s now way you’re going to visit Tokyo without a trip to Tsukiji Market. The inner part of the market is where you’ll find all the fresh seafood - the fish market part of the market. The outer part of the market is where you’ll find all sorts of Japanese street food snacks, some of which are seafood, others are not, and where you’ll find restaurants and all sorts of market stalls.

Here’s the list of everything I ate and where during this Japanese food tour in Tokyo (also, everything is on this map: 

Kitsuneya - legendary organ stew
Address: 4 Chome-9-12 Tsukiji, Chuo, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan
Organ stew - 850 JPY ($7.70) per bowl

Sea urchin (uni) - 500 JPY ($4.53)

Nishin Tasuke
Eel skewer - 200 JPY ($1.81) per skewer

Ajino Hamato
Corn fishcake - 300 JPY ($2.71)

Tsukiji Saito Fisheries
Giant oyster - 1,400 JPY ($12.68)

Home-style Sushi - 本種
Large plate sushi - 1,500 JPY ($13.59)
Chirashi don - 900 JPY ($8.15)

Matcha ice cream - 400 JPY ($3.62)

Tamago (sweet egg omelet) - 100 JPY ($0.91)

Blowtorched scallop - 1,000 JPY ($9.05)

Tenfusa Tempura - amazing small restaurant for tempura
Address: 5 Chome-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan
Total price - 2,500 JPY ($22.64)

This tour includes 10 different Japanese street foods. Probably my favorite thing of the entire day was the giant oysters, the amazing home style sushi, and the blowtorched seafood scallop. But really Tsukiji Market is a Japanese food paradise and a seafood lover's dream come true.

When you visit Tokyo, I hope you have an amazing time eating at Tsukiji Market!

510,DDdLkMCdRR0,Katakat at Tayyabiz | Karachi Hussainabad Food Street | Pakistan Street Food,"Kata-kat or tak-a-tak کٹاکٹ is a special meat dish originally from Karachi, but now very popular throughout Pakistan. It is made from offal (i.e., a mixture of various meat organs), including testicles, brain, kidney, heart, liver, lungs and lamb chops in butter. The dish's name is an onomatopoeia from the sound of the two sharp blades that hit the griddle as they cut up the meat. It is still an open question whether the correct name is kata-kat or tak-a-tak.

I shot this video at the Tayyabi Restaurant which is located at Hussainabad food street of Karachi, Pakistan

519,24SNu1e0,Tokyo Street Food Market Experience | Ameyoko ★ ONLY in JAPAN,"Tokyo's Ameyoko Market is the city's street food paradise. There is no debate. The market street runs for 400 meters along the Yamanote Line from Okachimachi to Ueno Station. There are hundreds of shops selling all kinds of delicious foods but its the market's past that makes it unique. 

▶︎ HISTORY
Ameyoko was Tokyo's black market during the US Occupation between 1945 and 1952, a place where you could get expensive and highly regulated goods like sugar.

▶︎ The ""Ame"" in Ameyoko means CANDY in Japanese. 
But ""ame"" also stands for ""AMErica"" since the market sold so many good broght in by US Servicemen during the occupation. You can still see sun glasses, watches, and Zippo lighters sold on the street to this day. 

The market has changed a lot over the last 75 years. 
After being a black market, it became home to Tohoku's seafood in the 1950s since nearby Ueno is the city's gate to the north of the country. In the 1970s and 80s, immigrants from abroad made their homes in the area and there is a growing variety of foods. With more tourists flooding the market, stands are converting from shops to restaurants at night, tables spilling into the streets. 

And then there is STREET FOOD galore! 
In this episode:
★ Kaisendon (Tokimakidon) 750 Yen 
★ Takoyaki 200 yen for 4
★ Potato-Rella Cheese Stick 480 yen
★ Kakigori (Kyoto Uji Kinji Milk) 400 yen/
★ Sake & Oyster Set 500 yen

Congratulations to Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) who recently was awarded a Michelin Star!

Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) is no doubt one of the most legendary Thai street food restaurants in Bangkok - some people are loyal fans, others say that it’s overpriced. It’s a Thai restaurants in Bangkok that I had been wanting to eat at for a long time, but never got around to it - partly because it is so expensive. So finally one day for lunch, Ying and I drove over to central Bangkok to try Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) for the first time.

But really quickly, about the name....

In Thai, Jay (เจ๊) means a Chinese Aunty and Fai (ไฝ) means a mole, yes a mole. What I can tell you first about the restaurant is that the owner is absolutely awesome. She wears ski goggles and a snow cap while she’s cooking, and she cooks over huge fire charcoal, fanning the flame as she expertly cooks. She’s also quite a character, and she loves to chat - so while I was filming she shared all about herself, and how her method of cooking her legendary Thai crab omelet ensures that it doesn’t soak up very much oil. It’s indeed the most amazing omelet you might ever see in your life.

Crab omelet (ไข่เจียวปู) - You can either order the 800 THB or the 1000 THB crab omelet, I went with the 1000 THB. It’s huge, but only uses 2 eggs, but it’s packed with shell less crab nuggets. The omelet is cooked burrito style, and  it’s massive. It’s a must order when you eat at Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ).

Drunken noodles (เส้นใหญ่ผัดขี้เมาทะเล) - Her version of Thai drunken noodles (pad kee mao sen ya) is the dish I would come back for over and over again. Again, it’s not  cheap,  but the quality of seafood and the seasoning that she uses is superb. The balance of flavor will blow your mind - it’s really the best plate of Thai drunken noodles I’ve had in Bangkok.

Tom yum goong (ต้มยำกุ้ง) - For our final dish we tried Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ) tom yum  goong. Again, massive prawns and seafood were used, and she cooked it over charcoal. It was awesomely delicious, sour, and flavorful.

Conclusion:
Eating at Thai street food restaurants like this can be all about expectations. You have to go in knowing the prices are very high and you’re going to spend way more money than going to any other corner Thai street food restaurant. That being said, it’s a one-of-a-kind historical culinary legend of a restaurant in Bangkok. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience eat at Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ),  and it was an honor to stand there and talk with Jay Fai (ร้านเจ๊ไฝ), and then eat her cooking.

Total price - 2,370 THB ($72.32)

We made our way to Kuqa from Chengdu. We first took the train to Xining and enjoyed the Hui Chinese muslim Chinese street food and then took the train to Turpan and onwards to Kuqa, our final destination being Kashgar. The dishes we have been eating so far really reminds me of central asian street food. From the super flavor packed hand pulled noodles, to the roast deep tandoori baozi, it’s a great destination for food.

So far I’ve eaten street food in Chengdu, street food in Hong Kong, street food in Guangzhou, Street food in Shanghai, and street food all around Asia, but something as simple as the street food here in Xinjiang (Kuqa) really impressed me!

All the street food we tried, in particular the hand pulled noodles, which tasted like spaghetti, was fantastic! Even the bbq kebabs were amazing as well. The locals here speak Uighur and a little Chinese, so I got by communicating with them in Chinese, but would be better if I picked up some Uighur. Overall, our experience eating in Kuqa, Xinjiang was amazing!

Here are the locations in this street food video:

1) Roast Tandoori Nang Bread -
2) Sunday Market (Featuring Hand pulled noodles, pumpkin baozi, and roast tandoori baozi)-
3) Huge meat nirvana feast -

523,_AuXvnCLERA,The Ultimate Indonesian Food Day Trip - HUGE Nasi Liwet Feast!,"►Check out my list of 50 incredible Indonesian foods: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...
►Ken's channel: 

During my trip to Jakarta, I mostly remained in the city. But Ken and Gratiana from  invited my wife Ying and I to go with them and their family on an Indonesian food trip to Bogor and the surrounding region (about an hour from Jakarta).

Our first stop when we drove out of Jakarta and to Bogor was a famous place to eat Bogor style laksa at a restaurant called Laksa Bogor Pak Inin. It was exactly my kind of a restaurant, open air and local, with a wonderful friendly environment. The laksa was unlike any other laksa I’ve ever had, and it was fantastic. Laksa Bogor - 10,000 IDR ($0.72)

Next, we stopped at a place called Toge Goreng Pak Abung, which is another legendary Indonesian food stop in Bogor, Indonesia, and they are famous for serving a bean sprout snack. It was definitely a very interesting dish, including a mixture of bean sprouts and fermented soy beans. Toge Goreng - 7,000 IDR ($0.51)

Next we drove into the beautiful Indonesian countryside and to the house. After having some Indonesian snacks and refreshing coconut, we then took a hike to go look for honey. The beekeeper was sick on the day we went, so we we’re able to get any honey, but it was still a beautiful hike.

The highlight of this Indonesian food trip for me was the Sundanese style Nasi Liwet Botram family feast that we had. All the food was laid out on banana leaves, and we all sat and ate some of the most beautiful and flavorful Indonesian food. It was an incredible culinary experience.

We drove back to Bogor and stopped at Warung Nasi Ampera to eat a quick dinner, and because I wanted to try some ikan pepes. The food was alright, but nothing compared to the lunch feast we had eaten! Total price - 103,000 IDR ($7.46) for 3 plates of food

Finally, back in Jakarta, we stopped near Manga Besar to have some desserts and to finish of this incredible day of Indonesian food. Sekoteng - 12,000 IDR ($0.87), Wedang Ronde - 12,000 IDR ($0.87)

It was an incredible Indonesian food trip to the outskirts of Bogor, and a nice opportunity to get out of Jakarta for the day.

A big thank you to Ken, Gratiana, and her family for inviting us to their house country house and for the amazing food.
