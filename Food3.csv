Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They‚Äôre so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi‚Äôs scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn‚Äôt have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn‚Äôt small, but at the same time, it wasn‚Äôt huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I‚Äôd never had it before. It‚Äôs a big, crunchy kachori that‚Äôs stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It‚Äôs an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn‚Äôt contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn‚Äôt wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it‚Äôs a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don‚Äôt miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

4,Rs3HnGVQIxI,UNIQUE Vegetarian STREET FOOD Tour in Hyderabad | Live Soda + Ice Cream Dosa + Pav Bhaji Manchuria,"‚ñ∫ More Street Food in Hyderabad:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt3mt...

‚ñ∫ Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks: 

Even though the city of Hyderabad is more famous for its legendary quintessential non vegetarian wonders that are evidently more conspicuous in its culinary landscape, there is absolutely no dearth of delectable native or popular vegetarian delights in the city. So in this fun filled gastronomic sojourn we braced ourselves to gorge on some delicious vegetarian street side dishes that are widely popular among  the locals. Our host, Sankalp Vishnu, a renowned food expert in the city, took us around the vibrant locality across P G Road, Sindhi colony, Secunderabad that is well known for a wide range of regional vegetarian street food offerings. Let‚Äôs get started.

Our first stop was Top and Tasty, where we tried the Indo chinese style Manchuria pav bhaji. This innovative take on the regular pav bhaji was indeed very delicious. The garlic,red chilli punch as imbibed from the manchurian style of cooking made the dish surprisingly indulgent. 

The second stop was Shivaling Chaat corner where we tried a delicious serving of Hyderabadi style matar(yellow pea) chaat. This savoury and tangy playful dish was topped with sweetened curd, sev and sweet chutney. Unlike its North Indian counterparts, this chaat was served hot. Though that didn't diminish the fun.

The third joint that we stopped by was the Chachaji food cart where we got to taste a delicious Dabeli, a popular Gujarati snack. The perfectly balanced sweet and savoury flavour of the Dabeli was beautifully complemented by the super tasty peanut chutney. It‚Äôs a must try snack if you love the sweet notes in your dish.

The fourth place where we halted was a dosa kiosk named Dosa Verito,right outside the Mayur Pan shop. It boasts of 151 varieties of dosas. After much deliberation we settled for the macaroni pasta dosa and blueberry ice cream dosa. The former one was super cheesy and irresistible while the latter one was a truly luscious fusion treat. 

Our fifth stop was Bombay chaat house where we tried the Hyderabadi version of the Mumbai special Vada Pav. The dry garlic chutney and the unusual garnish of chopped onions enhanced its taste. 

From there we went on to our sixth stop, the Famous and Live Soda where we tried their best selling item the digest soda that is essentially soda mixed with a concentrate prepared with sugar and digestive spices like cumin ,rock salt etc. It was super refreshing and appeasing. 

This delectable veg street food journey concluded with a Paan treat from the popular paan shop in the area the Dimmy‚Äôs Paan Place. Its was a perfect way to end this awesome exploration. 

We confer our heartfelt thanks to Sankalp Bhai for introducing us to the best veg street food offerings.

6,GMPh6t-lwjM,"Indian STREET FOOD Tour at Night - Momos, Vada Pav & Chicken Tandoori | Jorhat, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

One of the things I love the most about travel is that destinations are never just one thing. They‚Äôre multi-layered and diverse. A prime example of that is India, a country I‚Äôve now visited three times. The states of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, which I explored in March of 2019, are so different from other parts of the country, from the people to the culture to the landscapes to the food. It‚Äôs so exciting to get more of a sense of what India is and I‚Äôm thrilled to share this gorgeous and unique region with you!

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

My first night in the Assamese city of Jorhat continued as my friend Rishi and I headed out on a nighttime street food tour I will never forget! Jorhat is very close to China, so there are lots of Chinese and even Mongolian influences in the cuisine there. I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste them for myself!

First, we headed to Break Time to get some momos. These momos are steamed first and then fried. A rich and spicy red sauce with pepper and chilies is made and the momos are stir-fried with it. These momos weren‚Äôt too hot and I loved the red sauce! They were the best fried momos I‚Äôd ever had. They were still crunchy on the outside and super juicy in the middle. The chicken inside was minced and perfectly cooked. They‚Äôre super filling and were like spicy, Szechwan-inspired momos. I was in love with them! You get a massive plate of them for only 60 rupees, or roughly $0.86 U.S.

Next, we headed back out and got some Vada Pav at Delhi Chaat House. Vada Pav is a potato fritter that is served on a bun with chutneys and is sometimes referred to as an Indian burger. I‚Äôd had it before in Mumbai and Pune and couldn‚Äôt wait to try it again. It was served with mustard, sweet sauce, coriander chutney, and a spicy sauce. The sweet sauce was so tasty. The bun was super fluffy and the spicy sauce was really hot! I also loved the coriander chutney. It was an amazing potato mash sandwich! It only cost about 40 rupees, or about $0.58 U.S.  

After that, we continued our street food tour by heading back out and getting some spicy chicken wings at Seev‚Äôs. They use the second spiciest peppers in the world, ghost peppers, in their wings. There was a honey glazed sauce on it that contained the peppers. The chicken wasn‚Äôt that hot but was super juicy. The heat made my lips tingle a little bit as I continued eating.

We also got some double-marinated chicken tandoori drumsticks, which had a thick, white sauce on them. I loved the smoky flavor and the glaze was so creamy and cheesy. I was in love with them! I added some mint chutney to them which was great. The sauce was like a soft brie cheese. Our total there came to 450 rupees ($6.49 U.S.): 250 ($3.60 U.S.) for the wings and 200 ($2.88 U.S.) for the tandoori drumsticks.

Next, we were back on the streets of Jorhat to get some spicy pani puri! Pani Puri is my favorite Indian dish of all time and my mouth was all set for a spicy version of it! They‚Äôre made of leavened, hollow flatbread that is filled with an aloo (potato) mixture, chilies, onions, pani (spiced water), and a spicy sauce. It was super hot and really good. I loved the crunch and chunks of potato. I‚Äôd never had pani puri this spicy! It costs 10 rupees ($0.14 U.S.) for 5 puris and the vendor keeps giving you more until you say you‚Äôre done.

The vendor also gave me a dry one without pani that I liked even better! I could honestly eat pani puri forever. The dry ones without the pani were so fantastic! I loved them so much. They were both spicy and sweet and had an incredible flavor combination. And even though it‚Äôs 10 rupees for 5, the vendor actually gives you an extra one for free!

Our final destination was Ice Station, where we got some rose lassi. I hadn‚Äôt had lassi in a while and I wanted to cool my mouth off after the spicy pani puri. It was delicious and milky and more like a shake. They put nuts on top, which add a nice crunch. I‚Äôd had a thicker lassi in Amritsar but I really liked this one, too. It had a nice rose flavor and helped me beat the fiery feeling in my mouth, so it did the trick! 

I hope you loved my nighttime street food tour of Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment. Also, please subscribe to my channel.

ü•íABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be. 

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!

34,C0mxVHEwurY,Ultimate NonVeg Thali with Biryani in Pune | Masaledar Biryani House | Indian Food Vlog,"Hello Hungry heads!

I got invited to Masaledaar Biryani House, located in the heart of  city and I was more than happy to try their . 

I also tried their  fried in eggs, a starter dish that is extremely tasty. 

In the Thali, I got one fried chicken bowl, which was peppery hot. I also savoured the mutton masala which had a coconut based gravy and that was spicy too. Their chicken and mutton dum biryanis and both lightly flavoured balancing out the other spicy items in the Thali.

What I loved the most though, was their Pandhra Rassa which had an overpowering taste of ginger that was a perfect addition to the meat.

The Sol Kadhi was on the sweeter side, but thick and smooth. 

You can reach Masaledaar Biryani House here: 532, Sadashiv Peth, Jondhale Chowk, Kumthekar Road, Sadashiv Peth, Jondhale Chowk., Pune, Maharashtra 411030

36,6WSkWLd-pGQ,What Do Rickshaw Drivers Eat? Indian Food Tour,"I stumbled upon a group of rickshaw drivers parked up at a roadside restaurant just a few metres from the Indian Prime Minister's house, so I knew the food had to be great!

The Indian rickshaw drivers were all there for a ‚Çπ30 thali (plate of food). It's a massive plate with dal, rice, pakora, and papad on it. Drivers in India need a big feed at lunch because they work such long hours, and this was the perfect place for them to get it.

I also interview the owner and take you behind the scenes to the kitchen where this Indian street food is being prepared - although it's not very clean! The restaurant is actually on Government land and could be moved on at any point, but so far it's been there for many years.

43,kbhUxAvQEW,BARBEQUE NATION UNLIMITED INDIAN FOOD FOREIGNER REACTION | TRAVEL VLOG IV,"Barbeque Nation is an all you can eat Indian food restaurant chain in India. As a foreigner I have never been to this restaurant. However I have heard Indian people raving about the Indian food at Barbeque Nation so it was time for this foreigner to try it.

Barbeque Nation doesn‚Äôt just have barbecued Indian food like the name would suggest. I discovered there‚Äôs a really nice Indian food buffet for the main courses and the desserts. You do get a barbecue on your table for the starters and as a foreigner it is worth telling them to go for the mild spice level.

This is the review on my first time at Barbeque Nation as a foreigner.

PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video:  and this one: 

Q How do you work together with brands?
A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: ",Food

47,giQMvHf9teY,"Trying Indian Food in Tokyo, Japan!","Come join us as we try Indian food in Tokyo, Japan. It had been a while since Audrey and I had Indian food so when we noticed a few Indian restaurants in our neighbourhood that we were staying in Tokyo we jumped at the opportunity. The Indian restaurant we decided upon (Milan) ended up specializing mostly in North Indian Food and we decided to go for a variety of different curries, naan breads, samosas and chicken tikka. The following is a list of the Indian dishes we tried at this restaurant:

1) Samosas (Deep fried Indian savory dish featuring potatoes, pees and spices)
2) Chicken Tikka (Boneless chicken baked on a skewer coated with spices and yoghurt)
3) Palak Paneer (Spinach Indian curry with cottage cheese)
4) Paneer Butter Masala (Rich Indian curry with masala spices, extra butter and cottage cheese)
5) Garlic Naan (Indian flatbread with garlic)
6) Cheese Naan (Indian flatbread stuffed with cheese)
7) Butter Naan (Indian flatbread with butter)

Rob's channel: 

Our overall review of trying Indian food in Tokyo, Japan was positive. We found the curries to be rich, spicy and savoury while the naan was massive, buttery and crispy on the outside and gooey in the middle. In terms of price point it came to just over 4000 Yen in total which was roughly $13 US dollars per person. We thought that was excellent value considering Tokyo is an expensive city.

Trying Indian Food in Tokyo, Japan Travel Food Video Transcript:

 It is dinner and we're hungry and we're bringing our appetites. The area that we're staying in apparently has a lot of Indian food restaurants and we've got Indian food on our minds. We're going to go to an Indian restaurant order a whole bunch of different dishes and have an Indian food taste test It sounds good I mean I've tried Indian food taste tests a few times on my channel and they are always fun. I love Indian food. You love Indian food. And I know Audrey loves Indian food. And if you're watching this you probably love Indian food. Indian food in Japan guys let'd do it.

We actually have two Indian restaurants right across from each other. We can already see all of the different curries. Vegetable curries. Chicken curry. Check out that menu. Butter chicken. Lots of naan. We're going to get after it. Samosas. Lots of choices. This is looking good.

Take a look at this. Chicken curries.Vegetable curries. Aloo gobi is also good. Palak paneer. Spinach and cheese curry.

We've decided on samosas and chicken tikka so far. We need some curries for sure. I need a vegetable curry. Oh I like the paneer. 

One vegetable curry and the other one you wanted paneer butter masala.

Here is a cheese naan, a butter naan, a garlic naan, a vegetable curry, a spinach one and a paneer butter one. And then there is a chicken tikka and there is samosas.

That was an official feast of feasts. That cheese naan was deadly good. Anyways the price was 4,450 Yen roughly about just over $40 US dollars so you're looking at $13 US to $14 US dollars per person for that entire meal. That included chicken. That included samosas. Three different curries. Three different naan breads. Yeah, that is outstanding value. You know this is an expensive city Tokyo. And to get good authentic Indian food for $13 US dollars per person. Yeah, that is a steal. Anyways we will see you with more food and travel videos from Japan. Ciao for now.

This is part of our Travel in Japan video series showcasing Japanese food, Japanese culture and Japanese cuisine.

52,jhnmHFo3Qlk,"INDIAN FOOD Dinner Cruise on the Brahmaputra River + Pani Puri | Guwahati, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ‚ñ∫ http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ‚ñ∫ http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

After spending six weeks in some of India‚Äôs biggest and most heavily-touristed cities, I decided to change it up a bit by visiting an area of the country that doesn‚Äôt see a lot of foreigners: the states of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India. Here, the cities are calmer, there is tons of natural beauty, the foods are unique, and the history is rich and fascinating. I‚Äôm so excited to share my experiences there with you!

My second day in Guwahati, Assam, India continued with something special for dinner. My new friend Kabyashree and I decided to take a dinner cruise down the Brahmaputra River, which is the widest river in India and the fifth-largest in Asia. Come along with us as we take a ride on the Afresco Grand dinner cruise and have some Pani Puri afterward!

The cruise lasts for an hour from 4-5 p.m. and costs 400 rupees/roughly $5.75 per person, but the cost of food is extra. From there, we boarded and headed up to the top deck, where there is an open terrace and tables. I went with a Kingfisher premium beer. Beer isn‚Äôt very common in India, so I was excited to have one!

We went with some paneer chili for me and chicken pakora for Kabyashree, which would come out at  so we‚Äôd have time to enjoy our drinks, chill, and watch the sunset over the Brahmaputra River, which is very important to the people of Assam.

I love paneer chili. It‚Äôs an Indo-Chinese dish with big chunks of paneer. It also contained green peppers and onions. I loved the flavor combination of them all together as well as the heat from the chilies. It is an excellent, spicy veg dish. I loved it!

Next, I tried the chicken pakora, which consisted of boneless, minced chicken that is fried into small balls or patties. It didn‚Äôt come with any chutneys or dipping sauces besides ketchup, but it went really well with the beer. 

The cruise was a fantastic experience. As we rode down the river, we passed the smallest river island in the world, Umananda Island. We didn‚Äôt go there because it was Shivrati, but we could see lots of ferries there. The river is also known for its river dolphins, which are the main attraction.

After the cruise, I wanted to buy some souvenirs for my family. Assamese souvenirs use a lot of bamboo and wood, and are usually animal-related. Then we took a rickshaw from the river over a tuk-tuk. It cost 20 rupees/$0.29 U.S., and is more eco-friendly than a tuk-tuk!

We visited an incredible shop with lots of amazing souvenirs including carved wooden rhinos, hats, baskets, lanterns, beer mugs, masks, and lots of other wood and bamboo goods. I bought an elephant mask and a deer mask and a farmer‚Äôs hat. It only cost 600 rupees/$8.62 U.S. for everything!

Then, because we only had a little to eat on the cruise, I got some pani puris from a guy along the side of the road! Pani puri is my favorite Indian street food and I can eat them forever! It only costs 10 rupees/$0.14 U.S. for 5 pani puris, so it‚Äôs an amazing deal! He gave me an extra one and then I had four more afterward! The guy keeps giving you more until you‚Äôre ready for him to stop, which is amazing. But with the mosquitoes coming out, it was time for me to go before I got eaten alive!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on our Brahmaputra River breakfast cruise, our shopping trip, and our mini-pani puri feast on the street!

57,xv_YH57C1MU,LUXURY INDIA FOOD: CONRAD BENGALURU SUNDAY BRUNCH BUFFET | TRAVEL VLOG IV,"India has so much to offer when it comes down to luxury travel and food options. Conrad Bengaluru is a luxury hotel in Bangalore, that only opened its doors last year. It is only one of the two Conrad properties in India. Yet it is one of the most beautiful luxury hotels in the city offering an incredible Sunday Brunch with options from India and Western food. 

This luxury Sunday Brunch buffet is an absolute must try as they offer 150 dishes and there's truly some luxury options included in that incredible spread. When in India you have to try a luxury Sunday Brunch at least once and I had to share this experience. This Sunday Brunch buffet with a lot of variety of food starts at 2400 rupees excluding the alcohol. I can guarantee you will have trouble deciding which food to try because it's all so yummy.

PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video:  and this one: 

Q How do you work together with brands?
A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: ",Food

63,ikLE8mv7tI,BEST INDIAN FOOD IN DELHI üòç Famous Indian Street Food and Restaurants in Delhi India,"We show you the best Indian food in Delhi, with the help of our local Indian friend! We tried 6 mouthwatering, famous Indian street food stalls and restaurants around New Delhi that we highly suggest you check out for a taste of authentic Indian food! Pani Puri, the original Butter Chicken recipe, South Indian Dosa and more!

This was Ryan‚Äôs first time trying Indian food, so for everyone who has been pestering him to try new foods, this is the video to watch!! With the help of our friend Minokshi, Ryan was able to try some of the best food in India and he loved it!

Our first stop on our Delhi food tour was Moti Mahal, a historic restaurant in Old Delhi which is said to have made the first ever butter chicken. Stacia also got a little adventurous and ordered Goat Brain Masala. Needless to say, the butter chicken was the star of this show ;) If you are looking for a good place to enjoy some Old Delhi food, Moti Mahal is our top choice for restaurants.

Second we ventured down to South Delhi to try one of the best Biriyani dishes in the city at Al-Nawaz. The biriyani is special here because it is made with raw spices instead of power, giving it a full natural flavor. The biriyani was one of the cheapest items in our Delhi Food Vlog coming in at 200 Rupee or $2.80 and feeds 2 people.

Third, and possibly our favorite, was a taste of South Indian food at Saravana Bhavan. We ordered paper dosa cooked in Indian ghee, Indian filter coffee, and some amazing desserts! 

We then ventured into Old Delhi to see a little bit more of the Delhi street food scene. We kept seeing these round fried balls on the street and these street food stalls are always so busy! We found out the snack is called Pani Puri, a fried wheat ball filled with either tangy or sweet liquid made to order. Pani Puri is considered some of the most popular and best food in India, as many commuters stand at the Pani Puri stalls for a quick snack while moving throughout their day.

Next up on the Indian street food tour we found ourselves at a night market near Jama Masjid. Some of the best street foods in Delhi is said to be lining these streets that come alive every night until almost midnight. We were here to go to the oldest restaurant in Delhi, Karim‚Äôs, to sample their famous Kebabs. Tucked away in an alley, we found the restaurant packed to the brim. The kebabs were good, but it‚Äôs the history that made this place special. If you‚Äôre wondering what to eat in Delhi, don‚Äôt miss the oldest and most historic restaurant in the city!

Last, but certainly not least, was a street food dessert made from carrots, pistachios, curd, and cashews. It sounds strange, but it was so good! Even though we were so full, this was one of our favorite little dishes. If you‚Äôre into street food India definitely has some of the best.

Thanks to Minokshi, we were able to try the best Indian food in Delhi and have an amazing experience. No, we did not get sick, so if you are interested in trying some of the best food in India make sure you follow this list! We hope you guys liked this Delhi food vlog and let us know if you have any questions.

We have some more India videos coming out soon, so make sure to subscribe! If you are considering traveling to India, please feel free to comment down below and ask about anything from what to do in Delhi, where to stay, or if it‚Äôs safe for women.

If you enjoyed this video, go check out of playlist filled with street food videos from across the world. Thanks for watching, we‚Äôll see you guys in the next video‚Ä¶ seeya!

1. Butter Chicken (Aslam Chicken Corner ‚Äì Delhi)

This fatty, non-traditional version consists of a crispy, roasted chicken that is swimming in melted butter and spices, but don‚Äôt let that keep you away from this phenomenal dish!

2. Buffalo Biryani (Mohd Tofiq ‚Äì Delhi) 

The buffalo meat in this layered rice dish was incredibly tender and juicy. The sauce, mixed in with the various spices in the rice, had me in Indian food heaven!

3. Bedai (GMB ‚Äì Agra)

Bedai consists of a puffy flatbread called a puri and a potato curry with cottage cheese. The herbs and spices in the puri made for a sensational combination with the curry‚Äôs slight heat. It took it to a whole new level! 

4. Kabab (Tunday Kababi ‚Äì Lucknow) 

These flavorful, spice-filled meatballs were soft and contrasted beautifully with the paratha and onions I had them with. Easily one of my favorite meatballs of all time! 

5. Chura Matar (Deena Chat ‚Äì Varanasi)

This light and fresh dish is made of rice, vegetables, chilies, and spices. The flavors and textures were outstanding and I highly recommend it!

6. Gatte Ki Sabzi (Jaipur)

This mouthwatering curry is made of chickpea flour dumplings in a spicy gravy. I tried it alongside Daal, Aloo Pyaz Sabji, and Bejad Ki Roti. The spiciness and different textures made this a standout! 

7. Rajasthani Thali (Torba ‚Äì Jaipur)

This thali consisted of crumbled bread mixed with curries and yogurts. It wasn‚Äôt too spicy, but was packed with an unreal amount of flavor I couldn‚Äôt get enough of!

8. Mutton Burger (Samode Palace ‚Äì Samode) 

This was a very fresh sheep meat burger that was topped with cheese, tomatoes, onion, and lettuce. It was almost like a delicious chicken burger!

9. Chicken Lollipop (Mohammad Ali Road ‚Äì Mumbai)

This is a fried chicken drumstick that is bathed in a delicious, bright red curry. It was very flavorful, especially with the ginger sauce it came with!

10. Pani Puri (Elco ‚Äì Mumbai) 

This puri, or hollow bread ball, is filled with a light curry that can include potatoes, vegetables, and spices. This one had a minty flavor I couldn‚Äôt get enough of!

11. Paneer Chilli (Juhu Beach ‚Äì Mumbai)

This dish is made up of a cottage cheese called paneer that is served with a sauce and lots vegetables. Like many other dishes I tried, it wasn‚Äôt super spicy, but was exploding with delicious flavor.

12.   Bahubali Thali (House of Paratha ‚Äì Pune)

This thali, which consists of an enormous, stuffed paratha and over a dozen side dishes, is remarkably flavorful and varied in its textures. It‚Äôs big, but it‚Äôs also outstanding!

13. Pizza Dosa/Szechwan Cream Dosa (Ram Ki Bandi ‚Äì Hyderabad)

The Italian-inspired pizza dosa is spicy and cheesy with a cooling coconut chutney and the Chinese-inspired Szechwan Cream Dosa is sweeter with a nice amount of heat. I highly recommend both!

14. Veg Biryani (Paradise Restaurant ‚Äì Hyderabad)

The spices in the rice, coupled with the yellow curry, paneer, and vegetables, made this one of my favorite biryanis ever!

15. Paneer Bhurji (Tara Chand ‚Äì Amritsar)

This buttery, creamy cottage cheese dish with vegetables and masala is like cheesy scrambled eggs, without the eggs!

16. Floating Pani Puri (VV Puram Food Street ‚Äì Bengaluru)

This spicy, bright, and fresh variation of pani puri is served in a large amount of jaljeera water. It was phenomenal!

17. Fried Squid with Curries (Chennai Beach ‚Äì Chennai)

This spicy, briny, and flavorful seafood dish is packed with herbs and spices and had my taste buds going wild!

18. Kathi Rolls (Nizams ‚Äì Kolkata)

These fatty, grilled kebabs wrapped around a chewy paratha are out of this world! The meat is moist and flavorful and I can‚Äôt rave about it enough!

19. Gujarati Thali (Agashiya ‚Äì Ahmedabad)

The rice, lentil, veggie, and eggplant dishes in this thali were full of contrasting flavors and textures that had my taste buds going wild!

78,OyxWVJQUC18,World Famous Hyderabadi CHICKEN BIRYANI | Biryani MAKING & Tasting,"The Hyderabadi Biryani needs no detailed introduction. This glorious delicacy is a staple for the locals and the go-to dish for the tourists. Hyderabadi Biryani is characteristically distinct from its popular counterparts because of its distinct aroma, taste, texture and the mode of preparation.

With the essence of Turkish, Mughlai and Arabic influences in it, the Hyderabadi Biryani has been an integral part of the Hyderabad‚Äôs culinary tradition since a long time. In this culinary exploration, we have set out to savour the dazzling aura of this majestic dish at some of the most famed destinations across the city. We are happy to be accompanied by our gracious host Sankalp Vishnu who is an acclaimed food critic and food expert.

We tried Hyderabadi biryani at two eminent places-The Lucky restaurant and the Bawarchi restaurant. Our intention was to understand the nuances or fine tuning of the variations in the Hyderabadi biryani as adopted by these joints. 

Our first stop was the Lucky restaurant that serves one of the best versions of the Kachi Gost Ki Biryani. We got the opportunity to witness the making of a batch of Hyderabadi Biryani at their wonderful, aromatic kitchen. The seemingly easy procedure entails an astute understanding of the dynamics of its cooking, perseverance and dexterity. The genial owner for Lucky restaurant walked us through the process sharing all the details of their prized preparation. We then tried the Nalli Biryani along with some other delectable meaty wonders. The feast ended with the lusciously amazing Khubani ka Meetha a dessert that‚Äôs exclusive to the city.

The next day we went to the acclaimed Bawarchi restaurant to try their version of the Hyderabadi Biryani. In recent years it has emerged as favourite destination for the same. The beautifully done Chicken Biryani was worth all the reputation. It ticked all the boxes of parameters that make the magic of a biryani work. A distinct feature of the biryani here was the pleasantly notable presence of the shah jeera flavour in it. Here we also tried the Hyderabad famous Double Ka Meetha and the Kaddu ka kheer. The latter one was the best.
 
While winding up this Hyderabadi biryani trail we couldn‚Äôt but wonder at the flamboyant stature of this apparently royal dish that rules the heart of the masses in and beyond this city.

 We are truly grateful to Sankalp Vishnu for his cooperation.

80,38jNjgQaD,"DEATHLY SPICY Southern INDIAN FOOD + Attractions | Bengaluru, India","In November of 2018, I visited India for the second time that year after falling in love with the country the first time around. For this trip, I decided to explore seven new cities with my buddy Sam from Sam & Audrey.

We started off at Bangalore Fort, a former mud fort that is now made of granite and dates back to 1537, when it was built by Kempe Gowda I during the Vijayanagara Empire. The fort played a role in the Third Mysore War when it was captured by the army of the British East India Company in March of 1791. Today, the fort‚Äôs Delhi gate and two bastions still remain, and a marble plaque commemorates the spot where the British breached the fort's wall.

Inside the massive, foot-thick gates is a temple, a little statue of Nandi (a gate-guardian deity that is usually depicted as a bull), and beautiful carvings of different animals around a tiny doorway. Throughout the fort are massive walls built with giant blocks of stone and a garden. Unlike other Indian forts I‚Äôve visited, Bangalore Fort is free, so go check it out!

Before we headed over to Tipu Sultan‚Äôs Summer Palace, we made a quick stop for some cold and refreshing sugarcane juice with lime. It was super sweet and the perfect way to beat the Bengaluru heat! 

Tipu Sultan‚Äôs Summer Palace was built in 1791 and is a beautiful example of Indo-Islamic architecture. As the name suggests, it was the summer residence of Tipu Sultan, a Mysorean ruler who died in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. The palace is built entirely of teak and boasts many pillars, arches, and balconies. 

There‚Äôs a huge terrace inside with balconies and walkways branching off of it, as well as multiple rooms below and a garden outside. The palace is gorgeous, but beware: the entry fee for foreigners is 300 rupees, compared to just 25 for locals.  If you come to take photos, be sure to bring a lens that can capture in low light.

Next, it was time for lunch at Shivaji Military Hotel, which is famous for its spicy non-veg dishes. Here, in order to get a seat, you just stand around and wait for someone to get up to leave! All patrons eat off of banana leaves, which you clean with water before you add your food.

With eight different foods on our leaves, including mutton biryani, ghee rice, chicken biryani, cucumber salad, chicken fry, mutton dry, chilli chicken, and liver, I couldn‚Äôt wait to dive in! As is tradition in South India, I ate everything with my hands, starting with the mutton biryani, which contained huge, tender chunks of mutton. Next, I tried the liver, which was so buttery and tender, and then I added the gravy from it to the biryani. It was minty and earthy and oh so good!

The mutton dry was fatty and had an unreal flavor and texture, while the chicken fry was so spicy it cleared my sinuses! The chilli chicken was also very hot, and mixing the ghee rice with the different sauces and meats was unbelievably good. It was so buttery! The milky cucumber salad helped calm down the heat. I also loved mixing the light and peppery biryani gravy with the rice. 

Without a doubt, my favorite dish was the liver. The sauce and spices took it to a whole new level!

I hope you enjoyed coming along with us for our southern Indian lunch and fort and palace tour! If you did, please give this video a thumbs up and leave me a comment below!

Food info:
1) Khad Lam (Slow Cooked Underground Lamb):

Khad lamb (means cooking lamb in a pit in the ground)
Earlier soldiers didn‚Äôt want to leave any trace of smoke so that they can hide hence discovered this way of cooking. 
Earlier it was rabbit meat but now since it banned so we are cooking lamb.

Making of garam masala- Roast all the following ingredients and pound it together: green cardamom, black pepper, cloves, coriander seeds, black cardamom, turmeric, bay leaves and  caramelized onion powder.

Basic marination- Make cuts on the leg of the lamb and put minced garlic with lots of freshly prepared garam masala. 

Next for the paste-mix red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric, salt and lots of ghee.

Add this paste to the basic marination with a base of rotis and banana leaves. Cover it with a wet jute sack so that it doesn‚Äôt burn as it needs to be in direct contact with the fire for 2 hours in the pit.

2) Junglee Mass (Wild meat)
Five Ingredients Recipe-
If hunting, you get stranded, these are easily available in any village
Red chilli powder, Ghee, Salt, Dal or lentil, Coriander seeds, Lamb pieces. In a wok, combine everything together till the meat is soft and tender.

ü•íABOUT BEFRS:
Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!

97,T1xQt1-a0zQ,Hyderabad's BIGGEST DOSA IN INDIA! | South Indian Food Challenge,"Come join us for Hyderabad's Biggest Dosa in India as we head over to Chutneys restaurant to partake in a delicious South Indian food challenge. What made this meal so fantastic was the quality of the dosa over the sheer size of it along with the amazing spread of six different chutneys, sambar and potato mash that came as side dishes. I especially loved the coconut chutney, which was sweetened, and made it feel like I was having dessert bites. One of the true highlights was seeing how the dosa is prepared with a behind the scenes tour in the kitchen.

Hyderabad's BIGGEST DOSA IN INDIA! | South Indian Food Challenge Travel Video Transcript:

Good afternoon guys! I'm in Hyderabad, India and as you can see behind me I'm going to be visiting the restaurant Chutneys. They make the biggest dosa here in Hyderabad. It is basically a giant Indian pancake. It originates from South India and man I'm hungry.

We are going to checkout the preparation of the dosa. This is really exciting. 

How big is your dosa? The big one is around four feet long. It is huge. It is incredibly big. And it can be shared for 2 to 3 people. 

This is so amazing. I've never seen anything like it. I love dosa. Dosa are one of my favorite things from South India cuisine. Totally agree with you man. Have you ever had one this big? My biggest was one foot and I ate that whole thing. This is going to be four times as big. I'm going to eat the whole thing. 

It is a two person job. Look at that. Two people need to carry it. Wow, that is big.

That is a behemoth of all behemoths. Look at the size of that dosa. Maybe the biggest dosa in all of India. The biggest dosa in the world. Right there in front of our eyes.

Look at the size of that behemoth dosa. The biggest dosa. Look at that. It is like, it is like my wingspan practically.

I think officially it is just under a meter. He said it was like about 4 feet. Three to four feet long and it is crazy how big it is. Like just look at how big this dosa is.

Before we tuck into this beautiful dish let me tell you what a dosa is. So Dosa is South Indian cuisine. It is basically an Indian pancake it is made from fermented batter. It has just two ingredients. Rice and black gram which is a dry bean.

It comes with six different chutneys, sambar which is lentils and tamarind and then a potato mash salad.

First up is a coconut chutney. Over here we have peanut, over here we have green chillies with ginger and then we have red chillies with ginger over here. This one is tomato based with corn and this one is chanada. 

Let's break this bad boy dosa in half. I can hear it like crunching. The thing that is amazing about it is it is kind of hollowed out. It is paper thin and you'd think oh maybe this is heavy. It is totally light in the hands.

In terms of eating it I believe you're just supposed to break off a piece a dunk it in. So I'm going to go with one of my favorite kind of chutneys coconut. I absolutely love coconut so I have a feeling that I'm really going to like this one. Let's take it for a bite.

Oh my gosh that is good. That coconut is so sweet. It is pure coconut. There is nothing else. And it is just gets absorbed so well with the dosa man.

How do you even sum up a meal like this? This is just outstanding. This dosa was incredible. The size was shocking. The quality was outstanding. I couldn't recommend this place more highly.

This is part of our Travel in South India video series showcasing South Indian food, Indian culture and South Indian cuisine.

BEST BIRYANI in Hyderabad, India | Hyderabadi Indian Food Review Travel Video Transcript:

Greetings guys from Hyderabad, India. And tonight we're going to be having Biryani which is a local specialty of this city. We're going to be trying it out at Paradise restaurant. They have multiple different kinds of variations. I think we're going to try as many as four. Let's go inside and check it out.

So guys now we're in the restaurant I'm going to explain to you about Biryani rice. The first layer is saffron rice then we have exotic masala rice in the middle and then you've got heavenly mutton at the bottom. Now there are a number of different variations as well.

So mutton is the most common and famous one, especially from this city. But you can also have it with chicken, different kinds of meat. You can also have it with fish, shrimp or you can do it vegetarian style.

So now I'm going to tell you a little bit more about the history of Biryani. Biryani is an Urdu word from the Persian language. It means to fry or roast rice. It is more popular in South India because this region consumes more rice. 

Mutton lamb. Thank you. Sir this is veg biryani. Veg. Thank you. And that is egg. Egg biryani. Wonderful.

Thank you. This one is the chicken. Yes, chicken. Oh wonderful. Thank you. That is enough. Hahaha.

He is just going all out. Hahaha. I know. I love. You've gotta love the portions man. They are very generous here.

Alright so I'm so excited to try the biryani. Like I've just been thinking about this all day long. For this to be the city's most famous dish and not only that but for this place to be considered one of the best places to have it. 

So it is a Qubani ka Meetha it is an authentic Hyderabadi sweet with stewed apricots. So if you take a look here you can see all of the stewed apricots in here.

And they asked me if I wanted a scoop of vanilla ice cream and I'm like yeah of course.

The lassi itself is kind of like a yogurt-based drink. It is very rich. Well I shouldn't be talking about until I actually try this one.

Woah. It is one of the best lassi's I've had ever.

Sweet. It is thick. It is kind of creamy. It is very filling too. It is like a meal in a glass.

Just been working on that lassi. It is so good. What a great way to end a wonderful meal.

Briyani here were incredible. We tried 4 different ones. Mutton. Chicken. Veg. Egg.

The mutton and the veg were by far the best. Absolutely loved it. So if you're coming to this city you have to come to Paradise restaurant to try all of these. Man it is just so good. I can't recommend it highly enough.

Anyways that is it for us for tonight. If you liked this video give it a thumbs up, subscribe to David's Been Here and also subscribe to our channel Samuel and Audrey. We'll have more Indian food and travel videos coming to you soon. Ciao.

Hey there, are you interested in making your own YouTube videos? If so, here is a list of gear I use to make the videos. If you have any more questions about it, feel free to message me at solotravelblog@gmail.com  ;)

CAMERA & AUDIO EQUIPMENT I USE:
Camera: Sony RX100 M3 ‚ñ∫ 
Voiceover Mic: Samson Go Mic ‚ñ∫ 
In-Field Mic: Zoom H1 ‚ñ∫ 
Tripod: Manfrotto Pixi ‚ñ∫ 
EXPLANATION: I try to keep my equipment as simple as possible. 90% of the time, all I use to film is my Sony RX100 M3, and all I use for audio is my Samson Go Mic (which I use to record voiceovers after filming). Occasionally I use the Zoom H1 for audio if I want to record audio in-field. As for the Pixi tripod, I sometimes use it while filming food, but most of the time I use it to mount my Samson Go Mic on a desk for voiceovers (in conjunction with the other accessories, listed below).

MODULAR COMPONENTS I USE:
Smatree SmaPole S3 (hollow pole only) ‚ñ∫ 
Joby Action Arm (arm only) ‚ñ∫ 
Joby Hand Grip (hand grip only) ‚ñ∫ 
Joby Hub Adapter ‚ñ∫ 
EXPLANATION: Because I'm often traveling, I prefer to have the lightest, smallest, most versatile components available. Therefore, I use bits and pieces from the above gear sets, and these bits and pieces can be connected together in a huge variety of ways. For example, they can be made into a long selfie stick, they can be mounted to my tripod to make it extra-tall, and they can be used with my tripod and Go Mic to position the microphone directly in front of my face while I'm recording voiceovers at a desk.

MICROPHONE ACCESSORIES I USE:
Foam Mic Cover ‚ñ∫ 
Pop Filter ‚ñ∫ 
EXPLANATION: To improve sound quality for voiceovers, I place a mic cover on the Samson Go Mic, then use an elastic band to hang the pop filter on top. This is not the best audio protection available, but it is the most minimalistic and space-efficient gear for traveling. The mic cover can also be used on the rare occasion that I record audio with the Zoom H1.

GEAR I USE FOR CHARGING ON-THE-GO:
Anker Mini PowerBank ‚ñ∫ 
Silicone Cables ‚ñ∫ 
Adapter for Micro to Mini ‚ñ∫  
Adapter for Micro to Lightning ‚ñ∫ 
EXPLANATION: Anker's lipstick-sized powerbanks are small yet powerful. I travel with two, so that if one has a low charge, I can charge it in my hotel while I'm out and about with the other powerbank. Using the powerbank in conjunction with the short, durable silicone cables and micro/mini/lightning adapters means I can charge just about any device while on-the-go.

129,YuNEwuwv-aE,WEIRDEST Indian Food Tour EVER! You Won't Believe! üòØ,"You can't imagine what we ate at this night market in India üò≥ This Indian food tour takes us to remote state of Nagaland where their traditional food includes dog meat, frogs, snails, worms, beef, pork cooked in blood, and more! It's the weirdest and strangest street food you can eat in India - or is it?

Most of the these dishes are not eaten around the rest of India. These, like dog, are very Northeast India specific street foods. Many people find these foods extreme and ""wrong"" but they're totally normal and part of Indian culture in this area of India.

This night market happens every year in Kohima, Nagaland during Hornbill Festival. It specialises in Northeast Indian street foods. It's the best place to visit to try this unqiue Indian food.

The lentil- and rice-based vegetarian dishes that have made Swagath a local favorite are not only delicious, but also extremely healthy. 

After spending time with the Iyengars in their restaurant and their tight-knit community of Edison, we see it's no coincidence that the word ""swagath"" means ""welcome"" in their native tongue. The minute you walk into Swagath, you feel like a part of the family.

135,Oe9_NDqjRdE,"Incredible BENGALI Indian FOOD TOUR - Seafood, Deviled Egg and Sweets | Kolkata, India","When I went back to India in November of 2018, I had no idea how magical and enthralling my trip would be. I visited even more incredible locations than before, had some life-changing experiences, and discovered new dishes that blew me away. And I got to experience it all with my buddy Sam from Samuel & Audrey!

For lunch on our second day in Kolkata, the sixth Indian city on our epic, seven-city adventure, Sam and I headed out on a mind-blowing Bengali Indian food tour! Come along with us as we try some Bengali seafood, sweets, and more!

My Film Making Kit ‚ñ∫ 

We started at Victoria Memorial, a building that was erected between 1906 and 1921 to honor Queen Victoria. The memorial is a remnant of the British occupation of India, and Kolkata (then known as Calcutta) was the capital of British India for two centuries. The memorial is a beautiful example of British Colonial architecture. 

Then, we met up with our new friend Navpreet, who runs Fun On Streets, a company that offers tours that highlight Kolkata‚Äôs food, history, architecture, arts, and culture. Together, we visited the largest second-hand book market in Asia along College Street, one of the city‚Äôs oldest and most chaotic areas, before heading off to Swadhin Bharat Hindu Hotel, for some authentic Bengali food!

After having some water in clay cups, we ordered a fish stomach dish (Chital Peti), a fish dish in gravy (Ilish), thinly-cut fried potatoes (Aloo Bhaja), a lentil dish (Mung Daal), rice, and a sweet-and-sour mango chutney palette cleanser. 

I started with the Ilish and rice, which was a little salty and pretty mild in terms of spice. It‚Äôs a spiny fish, so you have to be careful while eating it! It‚Äôs a lot of work, but it‚Äôs worth it!

Next was the Chital Peti, which was kind of gelatinous, but I loved it. There were some smaller spines hidden throughout it, I had to be very careful (and patient) while picking it apart and eating it. But it was very tasty and salty

Next I tried a heavenly combination of the rice, Mung Daal, and Aloo Bhaja with a squirt of lime, which was heavenly! I followed that with some Ilish gravy with the rice and Mung Daal, which was also fantastic. Fishy and flavorful!

The sweet and salty mango chutney was next and it was insanely delicious. It was very sweet and the perfect palette cleanser. It was so good I drank the sauce and ordered some more!

From there, we walked along College Street to Dilkhusa Cabin, where we tried an enormous, fried, hard-boiled egg with a lot of layers including potato and beet root. It‚Äôs known for being spicy and they weren‚Äôt kidding! Even with the mustard sauce and accompanying onions, it was very hot. It also had so many different textures that blew my mind! 

We saw more of the never-ending book market, which stretches for more than a kilometer, on our way to our final destination of the afternoon, Putiram, where we tried a cottage-cheese-based sweet called Rasgulla, which is a super decadent, spongy, and extremely sweet boiled cottage cheese ball that is soaked in a sugar syrup that was so good that I drank the rest out of the tray! It was a fantastic end to our Bengali food tour!
 
I hope you enjoyed our mind-blowing Bengali seafood and sweets tour in Kolkata! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment below. Also, please subscribe to my channel and click the notification bell so you don‚Äôt miss any of my upcoming food and travel content!

A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?

146,lPjFWi7ILtE,How to Make Tandoori Chicken Marinade | Indian Food,"Watch more How to Cook Indian Food videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/500347-...

4 bone-in chicken breast halves, 8 drumsticks; 1 tbsp garlic; 1 tsp ginger; 2 tsp paprika; 1/2 tsp fennel seeds; 4 tsp coriander; 1 tsp cumin; 1 tsp Kashmiri chili; 1/8 tsp b. pepper; 1/8 tsp cinn; 1/8 tsp cloves; 2 tsp lemon juice; 2 tsp salt; 1/2 c. Greek yogurt; 2 tbsp veg oil; 3 tbsp butter. Skin chicken; make deep slits 1"" apart on each. Toss with ingred except butter. Leave covered in fridge up to 1 day; turn pieces at least 1x. Bake at 500 30 to 40 min; turn halfway, basting w. butter.

It's called tandoori chicken because it cooks in a tandoor oven, which is a large clay oven that gets very, very hot, to about 700 degrees. So it cooks meat really quickly and keeps it very succulent. When meat is cooked in a tandoor it's always marinated, in usually a yogurt based marinade. So I'm going to show you what goes into making a really nice, simple tandoori marinade. 

First we have the spices that are going into the marinade. We've got mostly coriander, about a teaspoon of cumin, half teaspoon of Kashmiri red chili pepper. We've got about two teaspoons of paprika, that'll give some nice red color. We have a half teaspoon of fennel, a quarter teaspoon of clove, a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon, and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper.

Now, I use a lot of paprika to get a nice red color. If you have had tandoori chicken in an Indian restaurant then you know it's a really bright red color. And that actually comes from using a coloring agent. It's a natural coloring agent. But I prefer to just use the spices so mine comes out a little more of a salmon pink color instead of red. 

I'm adding some garlic and ginger here that's been finely minced. Putting in half a cup of yogurt. I'm using Greek-style yogurt, so it's nice and thick. Then I have a little lemon juice and salt and a bit of some canola oil. And we'll mix this up. 

You can cook all kinds of meat in tandoor ovens. It's a great way to cook lamb. Excellent with chicken. Seafood's also nice. And when you cook meat in a typical tandoor oven it's a very long, deep oven. It's like a pit, really, and you skewer the meat onto really long, long skewers. And then they drop the skewers into the tender oven and the meat cooks vertically.

Okay, we have our marinade here.",Food

Indian Food is abundant in Penang. Almost everywhere you go, you will be able to find amazing Indian food. Whether on the street, or in a restaurant, you can't go wrong. I brought a couple local friends along with me to my favourite Indian restaurant in Penang!

To me, Indian cuisine is one of the best in the world. Whether indian street food, or indian cooking in a nice restaurant like this one in Penang, I'm in love. I brought these local friends here as a taste test to see whether they would agree that it is amazing food at Sri Ananda Bahwan. We all agreed! We also enjoyed trying indian candy!

In the future, I hope to eat the best street food in india, trying out market street food and indian recipe combos from locals and cooking with them as well, at least that is what the dream is! I would love to go to Dehli,  Chennai, and Mumbai! 

After spending 2 weeks in Penang, I ate at Sri Ananda Bahwan in Little India probably 5 or more times, it was that good!

Here is what we ordered:

Mutton Rogan Josh: This was an amazingly deep mutton flavoured curry, flowing with juices and quite creamy!

Mutton Punjabi: This was what they served when I asked for the spiciest curry they had! It was quite hot and burning but also very pleasant and smooth!

Tiger Prawns: These were huge prawns cooked in a mild curry.

Garlic Naan: Amazing naan bread to dip in the curries.

Fish Head Curry: This was a classic fish head curry that wasn't too spicy, stuffed with a big okra and also quite mild.

Banana Leaf: They serve you rice on a banana leaf, with three side dishes to mix with the rice, that are unlimited!

Tandoori Chicken: Amazingly pungent and flavourful tandoori chicken cooked in their own tandoori oven!

It was all topped of with popadom and mango lassi to wash it all down, a truly amazing meal!

Matunga is an area that served the most authentic South indian food in Mumbai and I thought of filming the famous A Rama Nayak Udipi Shri Krishna Boarding Thali experience. Eating on a banana leaf is common across Indian culture and especially in South India a banana leaf Indian meal is what is very common. While there are a lot of options to eat thali in Mumbai, an authentic south Indian thali is quite rare in Mumbai and this is the best place to enjoy it.

167,lZ1KYwpBUE,"PUNJABI Farm Party FOOD TOUR (Indian Food, Daru, and Bhangra)","Check out all the delicious Punjabi curries and street food at this farmhouse party. I started with the traditional Indian street food appetisers and then ate the various Punjabi curries and the famous Amritsari Kulcha. But there's more, at a Punjabi party alongside the fresh Indian food is always alcohol and music. Punjabis know how to party! I teach you how to greet Punjabis and Sikhs too. Sat Shri Akal.

 How to greet someone in Punjabi
 Indian street food (appetisers)
 How I became interested in India
 Indian curries & bread (mains)
 Uncles drinking
 Punjabi ""Bhangra"" dancing

This was quite the party in India! I couldn't believe they had full catering. The flavour of the food was out of this world.

In this video, I also share my story about how I fell in love with India through its food. Then about how when foreigners think of curry, they think of Punjabi cuisine. Punjabi food has travelled across the world. Other types of Indian food are little known outside of India.

Here's all the Indian food that was available and that I show you in this Indian food tour video:

Delhi, India is a true CURRY HEAVEN, and we traveled here to go for this DEEP Street Food tour of Old Delhi! The Food Ranger (Trevor James) is in India eating Street Food! This walk through Old delhi truly was an AMAZING STREET FOOD ADVENTURE with delicious curry, amazing restaurants, and with so much tasty and UNIQUE Indian food recipes for our huge Indian dinner. 

If you love eating street food around the world and street food in India, or even all over Asia, you will love the street food in Old Delhi. You can find street food everywhere, where everyone seems to cook delicious Indian recipes for curry and SPICY dishes all over the street.

In one day in old Delhi, India, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the halal style. 

We started out the day with an AMAZING ramadan experience at the largest Mosque in Delhi, Jama Masjid. We picked up a ton of different Indian street foods to bring to the mosque and break the fast with all the locals. We shared the delicious food, and then went back to the streets of Old Delhi to try more food. 

The first food we had on our street food tour was the Delhi Fried Chicken, DFC, covered in Indian spices like masala and mustard. It was extremely JUICY and PLUMP!!! 

Afterwards, we tried more BBQ chicken and then went for a nice Indian dinner cooked by one of the locals in Old Delhi. His family recipes were passed down to him and his food was legendary! We ate Indian Chicken Biryani and chicken korma curry along with Buffalo Korma along with Kameeri Roti! It was absolutely delicious! 

After this, we went to the LEGENDARY Changezi chicken joint that invented the recipe for this juicy and flavour packed chicken curry dish! 

To finish of the day, we went for some delicious BBQ Seekh Kebabs, extremely flavourful!!


The addresses for these street food restaurants in Old Delhi, India, are found on the main street below Jama Masjid, Old Delhi, India.

He TASTED this INDIAN FOOD for the first time and his REACTION was amazing. He liked it very much. I was wondering how he could even eat the spicy food as the guy had put lots of RED CHILLI POWDER. He also asked for another plate of LITTI CHOKHA.
We all know INDIAN FOOD TASTES GREAT, not only native but also FOREIGNERS are amazed by the taste of INDIAN STREET FOODS though it is sometime risky to eat for them as they are not used to Indian food sanitation, water of here, bacteria  & viruses from here. Dominic sounds great in this context. He said , he has been eating Indian cuisines for quite long time. Like may foreigners he also comes every year once to India and stays for some months - travel around India and take photographs from social matter to foods to spices, everything, he loves about India.

About this video - While I was in Bengaluru/Bangalore, I hopped on to these 2 south indian restaurant, OOTA and Taza Thindi. 

OOTA- Serves some amazing south indian dishes with little twist. It's little bit on higher end in terms of price. But the experience is all worth it. Vermicelli Biryani is something I tried here for the first time., it's one of the most flavourful biryanis I ve ever had. Perfect for indian palate. 
Average Cost - Rs.1700 for 2people

Taza Thindi- This places is popular for various reasons. They serve south indian snacks items at a very reasonable price, maintain hygiene (very very neat and clean), and the food is served fresh and yummy.
Average Cost-  Rs.100 for 2 people 

If you are in Bengaluru don't miss to visit these two places.

192,rGvQrbaSliE,"Indian Food BUFFET at the Revolving Restaurant + Adalaj Stepwell UNESCO | Ahmedabad, India","Even though I have now spent a total of six weeks exploring India over two trips, I‚Äôve still barely scratched the surface when it comes to the diverse foods, cultures, languages, and historical sites that make this country one of the most incredible travel destinations on Earth. In November of 2018, I got to explore seven amazing Indian cities with my travel buddy Sam from Samuel & Audrey, and we had the time of our lives!

We started off at the Adalaj Stepwell, a gorgeous UNESCO World Heritage Site that is located just outside of Ahmedabad in the village of Adalaj. Ornately and intricately carved out of sandstone, the stepwell was built in 1498 by Queen Rudadevi to honor her husband, Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela Dynasty, and to collect rainwater. It‚Äôs considered a stellar example of Indian architecture, and I can certainly understand why! We explored down below before going up top to take some photos and get some amazing views. It‚Äôs one of my favorite attractions I‚Äôve ever visited in India! It‚Äôs truly a spectacular sight to behold.

On our way to our next destination, we rode through the down of Adalaj and saw lots of mud-and-brick homes and dairy businesses. Eventually, we arrived at Neelkanth Patang Revolving Restaurant, and it was a good thing, because I couldn‚Äôt wait to eat more Indian food!

The restaurant‚Äôs buffet (900 rupees per person, or $12-$13 U.S.) contained a variety of Indian dishes from different states and regions. We started off with a cool and refreshing watermelon juice before loading up our plates. On my first trip up to the buffet counter, I grabbed a flatbread called papad; a chickpea dish called channa chatpata; miniature pancakes with tomatoes, green peppers, red peppers, onions, and coriander; coconut chutney; a thick sambhar; idli; a potato fritter called Batata Vada; a chickpea dish called chole bhature; a dish that looked like palak paneer; Rajasthani pitod ki sabzi; and paneer padam.

I started with the cauliflower chili starter at our table, which was crispy and extremely tasty; a minty paneer dish; and a veggie patty with mint chutney. 

The Palak Paneer contained carrots and spinach and was delicious, and I tried one of the other paneer dishes with some ghee naan, which was fantastic. The idli, which is made from steamed rice batter, was nice and spongy, while the chole bhature was rich in flavor and full of spices! The mini pancake was incredible with the coconut chutney, and the batata vada was lightly deep-fried and still pretty soft. I went back to the naan for more of the paneer, followed by the crispy papad. I could see and feel the restaurant rotate as I ate!

By the time I finished my plate, I was pretty full, but our table had revolved around to the dessert area, so I grabbed one sweet and crispy jalebi and a spongy and syrupy rasgulla, which are my two favorite sweets I‚Äôd tried previously. I took a bite of each before combining them, which made for an intense and sugary combination! We then finished off our meal with a buttermilk drink called chaas, which is traditionally had after meals in Gujarat. It was sour, almost like curd.    

What an incredible afternoon! I hope you enjoyed our Adalaj Stepwell visit and our mouthwatering Indian food buffet lunch! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment below.

In this video, I explore one of the most popular places to have dosa, vada, idli and upma in Delhi. 
What's strange is that this place has no name, no address or anything but still is going strong even after all these years. It's super crowded during lunchtime(and unfortunately for me, that's when I visited).
I had the best and most average food at the same place with monkeys. This food vlog about crazy good dosa from an unknown place in Jantar Mantar Serving Indian Street food is not to be missed.

BUT, when such food challenges come their way, there‚Äôs only one thing they say: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! That‚Äôs the beauty of an EatTreat Food Challenge! 

We, at EatTreat, love a good food challenge. Be it catching food with our mouths or eating a whole watermelon without using hands. Or even making Ranbir Kapoor guess Mumbai street food, we‚Äôve done it all. If it‚Äôs funny, it‚Äôll be on EatTreat‚Äôs Challenge Accepted.

PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?

222,GfUIsHizsi,Street Food & Insane SEAFOOD in Mumbai India,"If you love street food, then Juhu Beach is the place to be when in Mumbai. It's a popular hangout place for locals and tourists where you can find a variety of stalls selling Indian food, Pan Asian food, and all sorts of desserts. 

Right after the stop for street food, we went to a Gomantak Restaurant that specializes in Malvani cuisine, which basically serves a lot of seafood. One of the must-try items was the Bombay Duck Fry (which isn't duck, but fish) as well as the Pomfret Masala.

Shawarmas are a very popular street snack in India, and I went a little crazy and went for a chocolate shawarma that a nearby restaurant stall sold. It was pretty interesting and a combination I have never thought of. 

Finally, we ended it all with some Kulfi! Kulfi is a very authentic type of Indian ice cream that is super creamy! The man who sells it has been at this location for over 23 years! What's crazy is that he gets up every morning, makes it for 5-6 hours, rides his bike for one hour (with this huge bin of kulfi ON the bike), sells it, rides his bike back, and repeats! His hard work really pays off, because this was probably the best kulfi I have had in India.

227,Y2ZSxzLF0Ak,Amazing INDIAN FOOD in MALAYSIA - the ULTIMATE BANANA LEAF RICE | Food and Travel Channel | Selangor,"Subscribe for more food and travel videos: https://goo.gl/9rfeRS
Banana leaf rice is a South Indian style of eating/dish which involves a meal of rice, curries and vegetables being served on a banana leaf. 

We visit Sri Ganapathi Mess with our friends Jean and Drake who reckon that Sri Ganapathi Mess does one of the best banana leaf rice in the Klang Valley.

What makes Sri Ganpathi Mess unique is that it‚Äôs a restaurant within a family home. Different rooms of the house make up the dining areas. A vegetarian banana leaf rice meals starts with a choice of parboiled rice or white rice and then 4 vegetable portions. You get a choice of curry sauces for your rice and then you can add protein dishes to your meal.

In addition to our vegetarian banana leaf rice meals we order fried squid, mutton varuval and chicken rasam (chicken soup). The fried squid is a must eat! Thin squid rings, lightly battered and fried to a chewy crisp together with lightly battered onion rings. Absolutely delicious! We loved our meal at Sri Ganapathi Mess- each element of the banana leaf rice was unique and had it‚Äôs own distinct character. The chicken rasam was full of flavour and accompanied the meal perfectly. Well worth a visit!

A huge thanks to Jean and Drake for taking us to Sri Ganapathi Mess!!

245,16wg_rjo0pQ,Learning to eat INDIAN FOOD in Singapore's Little India,"Location: Little India, Singapore

Today we ventured to Singapore's Little India to enjoy some delicious Indian food! Before we started traveling, we never ate Indian food. Little did we know what we were missing out on. Little Indian in Singapore was the perfect place to experience authentic meal of Indian Food.

We ducked into a local Indian restaurant where we were the only tourist. We ordered some things that sounded kinda familiar, but when the food arrived, we realized we had to no clue how to properly eat Indian food.

The Indian man running the restaurant took us under his wing, and showed us how to eat with our hands. He was very picky about our form, which we both thought was funny. We learned how to properly push the food into our mouths using our thumbs.

248,n03y9PWA,Trying Indian Food FOR THE FIRST TIME w/ Liane V! | Asia The Asian Does Asian Things Ep. 2,"‚ô° This is my first time trying Indian food! I've had samosas & curry before and Liane has tried chicken & fish tikka masala, but we've never tried any other South Asian/Indian dishes! I have no idea why I've had such an unjustified aversion to Indian food (maybe because it looks so intimidating/spicy and I have the spice tolerance of a white middle-aged soccer mom that needs to speak to the manager) but I'm sooo glad that I finally tried it. Thank you guys so much for the dish recommendations! Y'all got good taste ;)

Hey everyone! Today I started off my day by going to UCLA's Bruin Plate dining hall for some breakfast and I haven't been to a dining hall for breakfast in forever so that was great! I then went to work for a couple of hours and then went to the gym with Kelvin after where I was able to get some good footage of that for you all. We then met up with Emily and JR to get some incredible Indian food at this place in Brentwood called Indian's Tandori, like it was the best service and Indian food I had ever had, would definitely recommend them! Thank you all so much for watching, I hope you enjoy today's vlog and I'll talk to you all tomorrow!

After dodging about 30 cars who ran the red light, I made it to Lumpini Park, Bangkok's central park, for the music series Concert in the Park. The park is beautiful at night and afterwards I wondered into Silom 11 for Tamil Nadu restaurant. They have vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, but I recommend it as a non-veg alternative to all the vegetarian Indian places in the area. The evening finished at Marcel a newish and more high end French restaurant for tapas (mostly delicious and stinky cheese), and cocktails.

Indian Food in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Travel Food Video Transcript:

So it is lunchtime here in Kuala Lumpur and we're eating at one of our favorite restaurants. It is located in Chinatown and it is called Yusoof Dan Zakhir. Hard one to pronounce. And they specialize in Indian food. And there is so much variety here. Like Sam is going to give you a little tour of the restaurant but there are just so many different stations.

And look what just came.

The juice is here. That is amazing. Thank you.

Mango. So we got mango juice. But yeah, like I was saying there are so many different stations. There is like a tandoori station, a naan station. There is an area where like the food is already prepared and you just kind of like point and choose what you want to have. And there is a juicing station and yeah there is just a lot going on here. The food is great. I'm super excited to eat here.

Something else that is really cool is the location is ideal. It is just right across to the right from the entrance of the Central Market. Yeah, so.

Great location. Yeah, and this place is packed. Like all day long. And that is how you know it is a good restaurant.

So Sam, as usual is feeling parched and couldn't quite make up his mind with the drinks.

So I basically always get a Teh Tarik wherever I go now. And if we're eating like local food it is available I get it. It is just so good. It is so cheap. And I'm going to try it here.

Oh man. It is just like the flavor of it combined with the milk and the sugar. And the fact that it is so cheap. That is why I keep ordering it all of the time.

Alright, and aside from that you've got some mango juice. That is really refreshing. Yeah. Lots of ice cubes in there.

Alright guys, so the food has arrived all at once. Our table is like packed with plates and bowls and dishes. So I'm going to start with the cheese naan. We ordered two different types of naan today. Cheese and garlic. Oh man, and these are like fresh out of the oven. This is like burning my fingers. Yeah.

It is really cool to see the tandoori oven. Yeah.

Next up we're going to try the chicken tandoori. And it is really cool seeing how they prepare this. Because they basically put the chicken on these giant skewers and then the skewer goes in to the tandoori oven and they're just cooking in there. Guess what guys? I'm going to show you where that is right now. It is right over there.

But back to the plate. So here we've got tandoori. Just look at that. It is all red on the exterior. Coated in spices. Oh, and they serve it with cucumbers, red onions and we've got a little bit of lemon or lime it seems.

So the other thing we ordered was a curry. And this is a fish masala. This is a fish masala. So you can see it comes in a generous gravy and I've just been hacking away at it here. Um, you can probably. I'll just go like this so that you can see the meat a little bit better.

Restaurant is shutting down for prayers. So we've got to go. We paid the bill. How much was it?

So it was 35 Ringgit which is at current exchange is seven dollars and seventy cents. Yeah.

So that was for four food items, three drinks. So seven things in total. Yeah.

So yeah.

A cheap and delicious meal.

Really good food. We are stuffed.

303,MpJUuBiaSj0,"Indian Street Food, Masala dosa, Paper Masala Dosa, South Indian Food, Dosa, Street food in Vietnam","INDIAN STREET FOOD, MASALA DOSA, PAPER DOSA, INDIAN CUISINE, INDIAN FOOD, Asian Street Food,  Dosa or Masale Dose is a variant of the popular South Indian Food, dosa. It is made from rice, lentils, potato, methi, curry leaves and served with chutneys and sambar. Though it was only popular in South India,[2] it can be found in all other parts of the country[3] and overseas.In South India preparation of masala dosa varies from city to city.[ Masala dosa was ranked number 4 on the list of '10 foods to try before you die', compiled by US newspaper The Huffington Post.Masala dosa is stuffed dosa. There are two parts: the dosa and the stuffing. The dosa is made in the usual way by soaking rice and lentils overnight in water and then grinding it to a batter. The fermented batter is used to make dosa. The stuffing is made from boiled potatoes with a seasoning of mustard seeds and garnishing of grated coconut, coriander, and lemon juice.
Ingredients[
Rice, husked black gram, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, salt, vegetable oil, potatoes, onion, green chillies, curry leaves, turmeric.
Dosa is a fermented crepe made from rice batter and black lentils. It is a staple dish in South Indian states of Tamil nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana. It is also popular in other parts of India, and other countries like Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore.
History
Dosa is indigenous to South India; its exact birthplace in that region is a matter of conjecture.According to food historian K. T. Achaya, dosa (as dosai) was already in use in ancient Tamil country around the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature.[2] According to P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the Udupi town of present-day Karnataka.
In popular tradition, the origin of dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with the Udupi restaurants.[1] Also, the original Tamil dosa was softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa, which became popular all over India, was first made in present-day Karnataka.[ A recipe for dosa (as dosaka) can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnatak
Dosa making
A mixture of rice and urad dal (ulundu) that has been soaked in water is ground finely to form a batter. The proportion of rice to lentils is basically 4:1 or 5:1. The batter is allowed to ferment overnight. After the overnight fermentation, batter is mixed with water to get the desired thickness. the batter is then ladled onto a hot tava (griddle) greased with oil or ghee (clarified butter). It is spread out evenly with the base of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake. A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is also served usually with chutney and sambar. The mixture of urad dal and rice can be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina.

Dosa can be stuffed with fillings of vegetables and sauces to make a quick meal. They are typically served with a vegetarian side dish which varies according to regional and personal preferences. Common side items are:

Sambar
Wet chutney: examples include coconut chutney (a semisolid paste made up of coconut, dal (lentils), green chilli and mint or coriander)
Dry chutney (podi): a powder of spices and desiccated coconut
Indian pickles.

1 1/2 cups rice 1/2 cup urad dal salt to taste Oil Masala Filling: 2 large potatoes 1 medium onion (chopped) 1/2 teaspoon yellow split peas 1/2 teaspoon mustard seed 1/2 teaspoon turmeric 1-2 green chili 1 tablespoon oil salt to taste Preparation: Dosa shell Separately soak rice and urad dal at least 6 hour or overnight in water. Grind to paste. Mix together, add salt with water to make batter. Leave in room temperature overnight. Mix onion and chilies to the thin batter. Heat pan or griddle with little ghee or oil. Spread the mix on pan in circular motion to make thin Dosa. Cook on both the sides, if desired. Masala Filling (Spicy Filling): Heat oil. Add mustard seed, peas, onions and spice. Fry for about 5 minut.  Indian Street Food, Masala dosa, Paper Masala Dosa, Asian Street Food. ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§ú‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç, ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§ñ‡§æ‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø",Food

Some of the indian delicacies were - chicken tikka, paneer tikka, pakoras, bhel puri, dahi bhalla, kadai paneer, butter chicken, murgh biryani, dal makhani, mixed veg and assorted indian breads.


I strictly stuck to indian but i missed dumplings though !

There was also a dedicated section of seafood where one could savour 
prawns, salmon, oysters, crabs, octopus and squids.

Unlimited grill and bbq kebab section showcasing chicken and paneer was surely the highlight.

Dessert is obviously my weakness and I loved the freshly prepared indian sweets, ras malai and gulab jamun !

311,-hS39lt8ig,LET'S TRY INDIAN FOOD - TRYING INDIAN FOOD IN LONDON,"Let's try Indian food! Today we have an Indian food taste test here in London trying Indian food because we like to try Indian food when in London because it's one of my fav things to do. We're looking for spicy Indian curry but we don't get any, it's just not spicy enough so this might be the end of my Indian cuisine exploration in London and I might have to go straight to India to get try real Indian food. Did I mention I love trying Indian food?

This is sorta one of those Americans try Indian food type videos but it's also Canadians taste test Indian food and a Belgian gent for that matter. So basically an international crew trying real Indian food.

Lots of dishes such as Indian pompodon, some spicy chicken tikka, naan bread, jasmine rice and some boar vindaloo Indian curry. We over ordered, eat it all and had a good time, another adventure in Indian cuisine trying Indian food here in London, England. If you haven't already,  highly recommend you do your own Indian food taste test at some point soon or at least try some Indian food.

Why you need to try Indian food now

Tiring of the same old standbys when it comes to eating out? Add some spice to your life by trying Indian food. From the humble pompodon to chicken tikka masala, there are a wide variety of dishes you can have thanks to this exotic South Asian cuisine.

In this article, we'll share a few tips that will allow you to have an Indian taste test involving dishes that will get you started on a culinary love affair.

There are plenty of spicy dishes

Bored to tears of meals that are hopelessly bland? Indian dishes like chicken tikka masala often come out of the kitchen with a kick that will leave your mouth and tongue in a gentle state of warmth for hours afterward.

Indeed, a big selling point of Indian curry is not that it is just tasty, but that it provides a dose of heat that will excite those wanting to try real Indian food.

Don't stop at spicy Indian curry, though ‚Äì there are many amazing dishes when it comes to Indian cuisine. Tandoori chicken, naan, aloo, vindaloo, samosas ‚Äì with countless regions comprising the Indian Subcontinent, the variety of food on offer will make your head spin. 

When tasting Indian food, don't make it a one shot deal, as it is impossible to get a handle on what Indian cuisine by eating at a single restauarnt.

Make sure you get it as hot as the locals

If you are going to try Indian food taste test and you aren't Indian, there's a good chance the wait staff will fill the cooks in on this fact. Knowing this, they will ease up on the spice, giving you less of an authentic experience.

This happens a lot when Americans try Indian food or when Canadians try Indian food, so if you want to try real Indian food, so you need to be aware of this fact.


While a pompodon isn't supposed to be spicy, many other dishes should make you feel the heat when you eat them during an Indian food taste test.

When the waiter/waitress takes your order, make it abundantly clear you are trying Indian cuisine in an authentic manner.

When the average Canadian taste test Indian food, there is a lot of hesitance on the part of the restaurant to make the food with a 'normal' level of spiciness, as this can have a negative effect on their rating on sites like Yelp and Urban Spoon. 

Be insistent on this matter, though, and they will apply the same amount of spice they would when making an Indian curry for a fellow citizen. 

While this level of heat might be a shock to you at first, this is you will learn how Indian food taste rather than being fooled like all the others who are trying Indian food for the first time.

Sample meals from across the Indian Subcontinent

As mentioned earlier, Indian cuisine varies from north to south, west to east. For example, Pubjabi food differs a great deal from Goan food.

Before you sit down for your India food taste test, get ideas from sources such as Wikipedia (tip: Google 'Indian cuisine') and Indian friends, and then book reservations at local restaurants who specialize in specific types of Indian food.

Throughout your journey, you might end up having spicy curry from the state of Odisha, tandoori chicken of Punjab, or a plate of thali from Rajasthan.

At the end of your Indian food taste test foreigners, you will appreciate one of the world's greatest cuisines in the way locals experience it everyday.",Food

318,AfefPeTO,How to Eat: Indian food,"YouTube personality KayRay, whose name is Kiran Rai, and Aparita Bhandari walk us through how to eat Indian food from Bombay Street Food Company on Bay Street. For more on this topic visit the Toronto Star:  Or read an excerpt below:

Exploring Indian street food: How to eat

This is the first in a series in which Aparita Bhandari explores how to eat the diverse foods available in Toronto.

This is the first in a weekly series in which reporter Aparita Bhandari explores how to eat the different cuisines that make up Toronto‚Äôs diverse culinary landscape.

There‚Äôs a lot of foods I don‚Äôt know how to eat. But to kick off this series, I thought I‚Äôd start with one that I know well: Indian food. I moved to Toronto from India in 1998 and grew up eating Indian food, with my hands ‚Äî the way it is meant to be eaten.

It‚Äôs a practice that gets a bad rap. Some see it as unsanitary. In 2012, when Oprah Winfrey visited India to dine with a family in Mumbai for an Oprah‚Äôs Next Chapter special, she said, ‚ÄúI heard some Indian people eat with their hands still.‚Äù That comment, and much of Winfrey‚Äôs visit to India, was criticized for presenting stereotypes and clich√©s.

Indian food, for the most part, is meant to be eaten with your hands. At home, I regularly abandon the use of spoons, knives and forks, especially when either my husband or I have forgotten to run the dishwasher. And I use my hands to eat everything from roti (Indian bread) and sabzi (vegetables) to daal (lentils) and rice. When I am at a restaurant, I‚Äôll typically use a spoon to eat daal and rice, but any type of Indian bread is best eaten with your hands.

So when I went to meet Kiran Rai, an Indian actor, fellow food enthusiast and YouTube personality known as ‚ÄúKayray‚Äù to share a meal, it was more to explore why we continue to use our hands to eat Indian food.

¬ª THE RESTAURANTS + FOOD 

1. CHAUDHARY NAMKEEN: Mirchi Vada 
ADDRESS: 119-120, 2nd B Road, Sardarpura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan 342003
OPEN: 11AM - 8PM

Mirchi vada, a popular Rajasthani snack or breakfast, are green chilies filled with spicy potatoes, dipped in batter and fried. We went to Chaudhary Namkeen, a family-owned restaurant that has been serving mirchi vada using their secret masala recipe for four generations. 

üå∂MAKE MIRCHI VADA: Boil potatoes, cool and mash them. Chaudhary Namkeen then adds their secret masala (using ingredients such as dry lemon powder, chilli powder, asafoetida, turmeric and salt) into the mashed potatoes. Grind the lentil and, using water, salt and red chili powder, create the batter. Cut a slit down the center of the chillies, add the mashed potato mixture and coat with freshly ground gram flour batter, allowing them to cook from the inside. Fry. Eat. To cut the saltiness and spice, many people eat mirchi vada with bread. 

PRICE: 25 cents/17Rs per piece
__

2. GYPSY RESTAURANT: Gulab Jamun Ki Sabzi
ADDRESS: 689, 9th C Rd, Sardarpura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan 342003
OPEN: 12PM - PM, 7PM - 10:30PM

Jodhpur is the highest consumer of ghee (clarified butter) in India. Rather than a typical onion/tomato-based curry, Jodhpur is known for using dairy products. Gulab jamun are a milk-solid-based sweet, typically eaten as a dessert; however, in Rajasthan, instead of soaking gulab jamun balls in sugar syrup, they cook them in a gravy made from nuts and tomato to create gulab jamun ki sabzi.

ü§§MAKE GULAB JAMUN KI SABZI: Combine refined flour, mawa (milk solid) and cumin seeds and roll them into balls. Fry the rolled balls in ghee, then soak them in water for roughly 15 min, until they become soggy. In a wok, add ghee, cumin seeds, hung curd, dessicated coconut, turmeric, garam masala, salt, red chilli powder, mawa and cook.

PRICE: $5/367Rs for thali buffet platter of 31 items; $10-12/800-900Rs per kg, if only gulab jamun ki sabzi
__

3. SHASTRI CIRCLE MARKET: Shastri Circle Market is an ideal spot to take a break and sample a variety of local foods after a long day of exploring Jodhpur. We tried pani puri and a special chaat. 
OPEN: 5PM - 9PM

PANI PURI

Pani puri is a wheat puffed crisp filled with a mixture of boiled potatoes, boiled black channa (pulse), salt and red chilli powder. Top off this tasty snack by filling it with flavored water and enjoy! 

PRICE: 27 cents/20Rs per plate (8 pieces)
 
THE GIRLFRIEND CHAAT

Chaat is a savory snack typically served at roadside tracks from stalls or food carts. The stall where we stopped offers a unique Girlfriend Chaat, known for its intense spice. True love is is put to the test by challenging your partner to eat this insanely spicy snack. It‚Äôs a mean test, trust me. 

üî•MAKE THE GIRLFRIEND CHAAT: Starting with baked wheat cups, add green chillies, Kashmiri red chilli powder, Rajasthani red chilli powder, black salt, chaat masala, garam masala, gram flour shavings, tamarind chutney, gram flour fried balls of different colors, pressed fried chickpeas, tomato and coriander. Eat and prepare for the heat. 

PRICE: 40 cents/30Rs per piece

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?

‚ñ∫ SUBSCRIBE NOW for more street food: 
‚ñ∫ Read the Blog post: 
‚ñ∫ Watch my Indian food playlist: 

There are dozens of Indian street foods you can eat when you‚Äôre in Mumbai, there are delicious looking delicacies everywhere you look in the city. But in this video you‚Äôll discover a top 10 list of a few of the best Indian street food dishes that you don‚Äôt want to miss when you‚Äôre in Mumbai.

For details about all these Mumbai street food stalls, read my blog post: 

1. Vada Pav - One of the most popular Mumbai street foods is vada pav, a spiced mashed potato patty that‚Äôs deep fried and stuffed into a bun along with chutney. Although it sounds simple and it is, it‚Äôs one of the greatest vegetarian burgers you‚Äôll likely ever eat. Also, when you eat vada pav, don‚Äôt miss eating some fried chili's to go with it.

2. Bhelpuri - Another of the of the foods that‚Äôs iconic in Mumbai is bhelpuri, a snack made from puffed rice, mixed with chutney, and onions and tomatoes. It‚Äôs an Indian street food in Mumbai that‚Äôs especially common at beaches, and it makes a fantastic beach food. I tried the bhelpuri in this video at Juhu Beach.

3. Sev Puri - This is one of my personal favorite Indian street food chaats, a combination of little crispy disc chips topped with mashed potatoes, onions, and a variety of delicious chutneys, and a handful of sev, which are the all the little crispy things on top. When you take a bit of sev puri, the entire little disc will explode with delicious flavors, and it‚Äôs all about that chutney!

4. Pav Bhaji - Originally made from leftover vegetables that were mashed up, mixed with some butter and spices, and served with bread to mop it all up, pav bhaji is pretty much exactly that today, and it‚Äôs an Indian street food known for being popular in Mumbai. At some of the famous pav bhaji stalls, the mixture of potatoes and tomatoes is mashed up on a big hot plate, mixed with spices and butter, and then served with buttered fluffy buns.

5. Kebabs and Rolls - For any meat lovers, kebabs and rolls are one of the best things to eat in Mumbai. I especially enjoyed the bhuna roll in Mumbai, a wonderfully flavorful chicken curry packed into a thin rumali roti.

6. Chai - It‚Äôs not a food, but it is one of the joys of being in India, and that is drinking cups of hot chai on the side of the street. You don‚Äôt want to miss it when you‚Äôre in Mumbai.

7. Pani Puri - Popular as a street food snack across India, pani puri is the combination of little puris (hollow sphere chips) filled with potatoes and chickpeas, and then filled with chutney and flavored water. Each bite is a burst of incredible flavor and water.

8. Bombay Duck Fry - Although it‚Äôs commonly eaten at indoor restaurant, because of it‚Äôs importance in Mumbai, and since it‚Äôs served at local restaurants, I had to include it on this list of Mumbai food. Known at Bombay duck or bombil, it‚Äôs actually a type of lizardfish which is often deep fried and served with rice and side curries. It‚Äôs something you should try when you‚Äôre in Mumbai.

9. Mumbai Sandwich (Bombay Sandwich) - You don‚Äôt usually think of sandwiches when you think of Indian street food, but in Mumbai, the sandwich is one of the most popular roadside snacks. Often times pure vegetarian, a combination of masala potatoes, tomatoes, onions, beetroot, cheese, and chutney is pressed between bread, and grilled over fired. The result is a fascinating street sandwich you‚Äôll never forget.

10. Dosa - Although from South India, Mumbai is a hub of Indian food, and you‚Äôll find dosas all over Mumbai as well. The classic traditional version is a masala dosa, but there are also fusion types of dosas, including the paneer tikka dosa, which is absolutely magical.

Thank you for watching this video about the top 10 Indian street foods to eat when you‚Äôre in Mumbai. Hope you have an amazing time eating!

330,iW8gWFrkKF8,"INDIAN FOOD IN PENANG, ROTI CHANAI, INDIAN FOOD IN MALAYSIA, PAPER MASALA DOSA","INDIAN FOOD IN PENANG, ROTI CHANAI, INDIAN FOOD IN MALAYSIA, PAPER MASALA DOSA, Jalan Alor is a unique food destination in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. The whole character of the city changes when you step onto the street. Gone are the modern shopping malls that align the city, which are replaced with something of the past age. During the day, there is not much activity but when the sun goes down, the street will be hustling and bustling with activity.
Some of the best culinary delights that Malaysia has to offer are not at the swanky overpriced restaurants but right at the sidewalks, in the rows and rows of hawker stalls. On Jalan Alor, these stalls will take up both sides of the road selling food that best represents Malaysia. This is not just a place for the locals but foreigners also frequently visit here to taste the unique dishes that they would most probably not be able to back home.
The best advice for people who wish to visit Jalan Alor is to bring their appetite. As mentioned, there are plenty to choose from here and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to try everything in a single trip, so it is important that you make several trips to this street if there is a high possibility that you will not be returning to Jalan Alor for quite a while. Here, you are not just tasting the food here but also the culture in Malaysia. Diversity does not just exist in the population but that very factor that makes Malaysia so special is also translated in its cooking.Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic group and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices and traditions.There has also been Central Asian influence on North Indian cuisine from the years of Mughal rule.[Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies.
Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have also played a role in introducing certain foods to the country. For instance, the potato, a staple of the Indian diet, was brought to India by the Portuguese, who also introduced chillies and breadfruit.Indian cuisine has also shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. It has also influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Southeast Asia, the British Isles, Fiji, and the Caribbean.
Penang is a state in Malaysia located on the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia, by the Strait of Malacca.

ABOUT FOOD AND FOOTPRINTS:

We are Greg and Jumi, hailing from opposite ends of the globe. Greg is a native New Yorker who was born and raised in Queens NYC and Jumi grew up in the beautiful islands of the Visayas region of the Philippines. 

How did we meet? One of us messaged the other on Instagram (before sliding in DM's was even possible through the app!) and we met just after Hurricane Sandy hit NYC in October 2012. Although we grew up in two very different worlds, we bonded over a love of experiences over material things, delicious food and exploration.

We have visited 15+ countries together since December 2014 exploring beaches, ancient temples, bustling streets and ruins. Along the way, we get adrenaline flowing whether paragliding, ziplining, or jetskiing.

To fuel up for our adventures (and everyday life), we eat lots of local food wherever we are. Street food, carts, trucks, hidden gems and family-run sit-downs are our mainstays. We don't cook, but prefer to spend our money on experiences and we treat food as one. Hey, we gotta eat regardless, right? May as well enjoy it and support good businesses while we're at it! 

All of this is done while we work full-time at our day jobs. How do we do it? Follow along our journeys and you will learn more. Welcome to our lifestyle!",Food

356,-x71ZFONYD,Healthy Indian Food | Dubai,"Healthy Indian Food In Dubai.
11 years ago, when I started my TV journey with my first TV show High Life Dubai, I had an opportunity to cook with the legendary Asha Bhosle in her then newly opened restaurant - Ashas. I was amazed to see how much passion and knowledge she had for cooking and good food.  We chatted, we laughed and she told me many stories about her journey in the music and film industry. She also shared her memories of many iconic film personalities, she had an opportunity to work with in her career. I kept going to Ashas for meals for many years after that until recently I was invited to review the healthy options on their menu. Needless to mention, I was thrilled and nostalgic.

Both the young and the adults are familiar with the legendary and melodious voice of Asha Bhosle and I am sure quite a few of us know some of her songs by heart. Over the years she has spread so much love with her sublimity that every single one of us has been touched by her and her music in some way.

Today, I am here to talk about another milestone of her life, which is right here in our city ‚Äì Dubai. Asha‚Äôs Restaurant ‚Äì situated in Wafi.  In business since 2002, the restaurant is an innovative style of Indian restaurant boasting a traditional Indian menu with Asha Bhosle‚Äôs personal touch.

‚ÄúGood food transcends any language or any culture, it has a universal appeal.‚Äù

With so much effort of keeping the architecture together, Asha‚Äôs food is nonetheless a treat to Indian foodies. Embark on a culinary journey with me, as I review some of the sumptuous dishes and Asha Bhosle‚Äôs own recipes; from their menu.


Well, you see I enjoyed every bite of my Indian food, but still keeping my clean eating options mind. As I have been repeatedly telling you, it‚Äôs not about eating less ‚Äì it‚Äôs all about eating right. Eat where ever you want, but just tweak it according to your health preferences. Ask the Chef to use less oil, or for any other healthy preference that‚Äôs there on your daily menu or if you are gluten free or dairy free like me, they will definitely take care of it.

I would love you to go and experience a meal at Ashas and that‚Äôs why I am giving away two vouchers worth AED 500 each. All you have to tell me is how do you make the healthier version of your favorite Indian recipes?
Please share with me and I would love to try them.
 
Be healthy and be happy

367,AZY1bYzN0lM,South Indian Food in Kuala Lumpur (Vishalatchi Banana Leaf Meal),"Go to http://migrationology.com/2012/11/sou... for lots more food and travel. Thank you very much for watching, and if you enjoyed it, remember to click ""Like"" and ""Subscribe!"" Thank you!

One of the absolute best reasons to visiti Malaysia is for its abundance of outstanding cuisine. And while local Malay and Chinese food are both insanely good, the Indian food is equally amazing. In Kuala Lumpur, much of the Indian food originates from the South of India, and much of it has Chettinad or Tamil Nadu influence. Banana leaf, as this meal is known throughout Kuala Lumpur, is basically a pile of rice sitting on top of a banana leaf that surrounded by a variety of vegetable curries and then one can also order meat or fish dishes on the side as well. The vegetarian curries change by the day, whatever fresh ingredients are available at the time are used. This particular day, there was an excellent beat curry, daal lentils, and some sort of okra curry.

Have you ever gone to a restaurant that was so good, you had to eat there multiple times in a row? That's exactly what happened to me at Vishalatchi Food and Catering Sou Indian Food restaurant in Kuala Lumpur. I had heard about it, and decided to go on a food excursion to go check it out. My first meal so so extraordinarily that the next day I returned fro breakfast and ended up eating nearly the same thing. I also returned again the next day for the same awesome feat, this place is literally that good! For this meal, I was greeted by the awesome South Indian staff, and when I began to film, they all were curious and wanted me to take their photos, it was great!

As for South Indian food, it's amazing. Along with the vegetarian side dishes at Vishalatchi, the meat and seafood is great. After long contemplation I finally decided on a bowl of dry fish curry known as fish puttu. It was nicely spiced and went extremely well with the pile of rice and other dishes. Another thing I really enjoyed was the bowl of yoghurt provided along with the meal. It just kind of brought all the South Indian food together in a harmony of flavors. The entire meal was so good, I simply could barely even believe it. For most of the meal, I honestly had to just close my eyes and savor every single bite! Another bonus of eating banana leaf meals like this in Malaysia is that you can basically eat as much rice and vegetarian dishes as you want - they will keep refilling your leaf until you surrender. If you do visit Kuala Lumpur this is one of the ultimate must eat at restaurants in the city, I know you'll love it!

Vishalatchi Food and Catering
Prices: I paid 13 RM for this meal and that includes rice and vegetarian sides (as much as you want), and also the fish dish and a tea
Address: 18 Jalan Scott, Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lum 50470, Malaysia
Here are some direction on how to get there: From KL Sentral, walk down Jalan Tun Sambanthan 4 and take a left on Jalan Sultan Abdul Samad. Then you need to take that until it curves to the left but keep straight until you get to Jalan Scott where you make a left. Vishalatchi Food and Catering is on your left hand side before you get to the Hindu Temple.

It is made from rice, lentils, potato, methi, curry leaves and served with chutneys and sambar. Though it was only popular in South India, it can be found in all other parts of the country and overseas. In South India preparation of masala dosa varies from city to city.[Masala dosa was ranked number 4 on the list of '10 foods to try before you die', compiled by The Huffington Post. Preparation : Masala dosa is stuffed dosa. There are two parts: the dosa and the stuffing. The dosa is made in the usual way by soaking rice and lentils overnight in water and then grinding it to a batter. The fermented batter is used to make dosa. The stuffing is made from boiled potatoes with a seasoning of mustard seeds and garnishing of grated coconut, coriander, and lemon juice.
Mysore masala dosa has a red chutney made from red chillies, onion and, garlic applied to the inside of the dosa before placing the potato stuffing on top of it. It is home to the Wembley 'complex': Wembley Stadium, England's primary football stadium and a major sports and entertainment venue; as well as SSE Arena, a concert venue. The former British Empire Exhibition was held at the Palace of Industry building at Engineers Way, when the district was part of the historic Middlesex county.
Today the district boasts a large number of pubs, along with new retail and housing developments near the stadium complex. The Chalkhill housing estate is also located in Wembley Park. The east is home to large industrial land, called Stadium Industrial Estate, adjacent to Brent Park. The north is mostly suburban upmarket residential areas, with the Barn Hill point behind it. Barn Hill peaks at 86 metres above sea level, and is part of the greater Fryent Country Park that goes towards Kingsbury.
In addition, Wembley Hill Road is a steep road west from the complex, which peaks at around 65 metres above sea level near The Green Man pub.
The Wealdstone Brook tributary of the River Brent starts off at the Stadium Industrial Estate and runs between Bridge Road and Wembley Park Drive, and through Forty Avenue towards Preston. Bridge Road is so-called for the bridge over the narrow brook.",Food

Whether it's Indian street food or the good old subzi roti, Indian food is something that is enjoyed in so many different ways. But what if I were to show you some good old Indian food with a twist! Im talking about Spice Klub - a restaurant in Mumbai. It actually has branches in Mumbai, chennai, Kolkata, Pune and even Dubai! So Spice Klub used molecular gastronomy with Indian Food and has a really interesting menu. It is one of my favorite veg restaurants in Mumbai and offers really good food. I would describe their fare as fusion Indian cuisine or Modern Indian food. Mumbai food has a lot to offer and I definitely think that this fusion food definitely deserves a try.

384,kUvisSDXFeI,Eating Indian Food to Lose Weight,"Today I‚Äôm going to talk about healthy ways to eat Indian food basics that I find most commonly in restaurant Indian food, usually, this is North Indian or Punjabi food.

1. Drinks
-Mango lassi - lot of sugar, plain lassi less sugar, prosecco even better
-If you‚Äôre not drinking alcohol, I would test Diet Coke and see how that goes. Check out my video on diet soda.

2. Bread 
-Naan, I love naan, pretty much all types of naan, plain naan, garlic naan, onion naan. However, your better options are wheat naan or roti it‚Äôs lower in glycemic index than regular naan which is made from white flour. 
-Wheat naan or roti has a lower glycemic index and won‚Äôt cause as much variation in your blood sugar levels, which is better for weight loss. 
-However it‚Äôs not so much lower in glycemic index that you should eat extra wheat naan or roti, it‚Äôs an improvement from regular naan but still high on the glycemic index scale, so don‚Äôt get carried away.
-The easiest way I‚Äôve found to do this is to slowly decrease the amount of regular naan you have. Basically, if you eat 2 naans, try eating 1 regular naan and 1 whole wheat naan. 

3. Protein and Vegetables 
-Paneer, technically not a vegetable but frequently with other vegetables like palak (spinach) paneer. Although paneer does have protein it also has fat. I would get this only if you‚Äôre not eating fatty protein in another source like meat.
-One of the best sources of protein is legumes so lentils or chana masala is a really good source of lower fat protein.
-As vegetables go it's best to switch anything with aloo (potatoes) for other vegetables like palak (spinach) or gobi (cauliflower). A lot of times it‚Äôs a mix of vegetables including potatoes or paneer, in that case, I would say try to eat a higher amount of the other non-potato/paneer vegetables. This is because white potatoes have a high glycemic index and will raise your blood sugar more.  

4. Quick review on why glycemic index is important
-High glycemic index food will raise your blood sugar faster and higher and your body will then want to keep your body at that blood sugar level. 
-So when you eat high glycemic index foods you will be more likely to feel like eating more to keep your blood sugar stable at a high level.

386,dhXEDLf2k8U,"EXOTIC Southern INDIAN FOOD - 10 Unique Dishes at Ulavacharu Restaurant | Hyderabad, India","In November of 2018, I went on the most epic trip of my life: a 21-day-long trip to India, a country I fell in love with the first time I visited just eleven months earlier. This time, I went with my good friend Sam, and we set out to explore seven cities in different parts of the country.

Subscribe to Sam & Audrey: 

The second city of our trip, Hyderabad, is well known all over the world for its amazing cuisine, so the two of us decided to visit one of the city‚Äôs most popular restaurants, Ulavacharu, to try some of the best southern Indian food in Hyderabad!

Ulavacharu is an authentic traditional cuisine restaurant that has won over millions of hearts of visitors from all over the world. This popular restaurant operates with the goal of reinventing long-forgotten recipes; bringing authentic, unique, and original dishes together under one roof; and keeping ancient dishes that were prepared by their ancestors alive for current and future generations.

First up was a creamy and buttery complimentary Indian sweet that contained caramel. It was very sweet and I only ate one!

Our first main dish was the Korameenu Tandoori Fish, which is made with masala and other spices and served alongside a mint chutney. It wasn‚Äôt as soft or flaky as a regular fish and actually reminded me of mutton, texture-wise, but it was fantastic! The smoky tandoori flavor paired really well with the mint of the chutney. If you order this, just be sure to look out for stray bones or spines that may not be removed during the fileting process!

Next up was Bangla Kodi, which is small nuggets of chicken masala wrapped in a potato. It was really good! Crunchy and not too spicy, just a little peppery, and reminded me of popcorn chicken wrapped in a crunchy potato.

Next, we had the Royyala Vepudu, which are river prawns with masala, cilantro, and a spicy green chili. It was very spicy, chewy, had a wonderful texture, and I loved it! They were the best prawns I‚Äôve ever had!

Next was the bamboo chicken, one of the most exotic dishes I‚Äôve ever seen! The raw chicken is cooked inside a sealed piece of bamboo and sprinkled with masala spices. It gave the chicken a strong bamboo taste, and was outstanding! Sam loved it, too!

Our next dish was Kona Seema Kodi Vepudu, a spicy fried chicken. Visually, it reminded me of Nashville fried chicken. It was super tender and slightly spicy, except for one bite where I caught a lot of spice!

To cool down my mouth, I went with some rose milk, a super sweet milk with cashews, pistachios, and almonds that has a lot of rose flavor infused in it. This was definitely one of my favorite rose-infused drinks I‚Äôve ever had! 

Our next dish was Pandu Marayapaka, a type of vegetable kebab with a flavorful and tangy sauce that reminded me of orange chicken. It was fantastic!

Next, I tried Ulavacharu‚Äôs signature dish, Raju Gari Kodi Pulao, a steamed rice dish that contains vegetables, tender chunks of chicken, spices, and a hard-boiled and deep-fried egg on top. It was very moist and reminded me of a risotto or a paella. I tried it with two different chutneys and a red, peppery sauce, and all three were very unique and so good!

Up next was the Matka Mamsam Pulao, another rice dish that was served in a clay pot. This one contained mutton (lamb) and before I could even taste it, the aroma of the meat with all of the spices had my mouth watering. It was the butteriest, most tender lamb I‚Äôve ever had!

Sam tried the next dish, Gadwal Kodi Pulao, a chicken-based rice dish with tomatoes that sits on top of an omelet! It wasn‚Äôt as spicy as the other pulaos, and was lighter, and the omelet was a nice addition.

The last dish of the night was Guthi Vankaya Pulao, a veg pulao with an eggplant on top. The sauce was very light and wasn‚Äôt spicy at all. I loved the eggplant, and the sauce mixed with the rice was out of this world!

¬ª THE GOLDEN TEMPLE
LOCATION: Golden Temple Rd, Atta Mandi, Katra Ahluwalia, Amritsar
OPEN: 24 hours/day, 7 days/week 

The Golden Temple is a Gurdwara, a place of worship for Sikhs, located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. The Golden Temple is the most important pilgrimage site of Sikhism and considered to be spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. Along with being a central religious place for Sikhs, it is a symbol of human brotherhood and equality, as people from all faiths, as well as those who do not profess any faith, are welcomed. 

The Golden Temple is home to a Langar, a community-run free kitchen and dining hall where food is served around the clock to all visitors, regardless of faith, gender, nationality or economic background. There are thousands of Sikh volunteers cooking and serving the food as well as cleaning after visitors finish eating. Each day, thousands of people from varied backgrounds come to The Golden Temple, sit on the floor and eat together as equals. All of the food served is vegetarian.

Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Hey there, are you interested in making your own YouTube videos? If so, here is a list of gear I use to make the videos. If you have any more questions about it, feel free to message me at solotravelblog@gmail.com  ;)

CAMERA & AUDIO EQUIPMENT I USE:
Camera: Sony RX100 M3 ‚ñ∫ 
Voiceover Mic: Samson Go Mic ‚ñ∫ 
In-Field Mic: Zoom H1 ‚ñ∫ 
Tripod: Manfrotto Pixi ‚ñ∫ 
EXPLANATION: I try to keep my equipment as simple as possible. 90% of the time, all I use to film is my Sony RX100 M3, and all I use for audio is my Samson Go Mic (which I use to record voiceovers after filming). Occasionally I use the Zoom H1 for audio if I want to record audio in-field. As for the Pixi tripod, I sometimes use it while filming food, but most of the time I use it to mount my Samson Go Mic on a desk for voiceovers (in conjunction with the other accessories, listed below).

MODULAR COMPONENTS I USE:
Smatree SmaPole S3 (hollow pole only) ‚ñ∫ 
Joby Action Arm (arm only) ‚ñ∫ 
Joby Hand Grip (hand grip only) ‚ñ∫ 
Joby Hub Adapter ‚ñ∫ 
EXPLANATION: Because I'm often traveling, I prefer to have the lightest, smallest, most versatile components available. Therefore, I use bits and pieces from the above gear sets, and these bits and pieces can be connected together in a huge variety of ways. For example, they can be made into a long selfie stick, they can be mounted to my tripod to make it extra-tall, and they can be used with my tripod and Go Mic to position the microphone directly in front of my face while I'm recording voiceovers at a desk.

MICROPHONE ACCESSORIES I USE:
Foam Mic Cover ‚ñ∫ 
Pop Filter ‚ñ∫ 
EXPLANATION: To improve sound quality for voiceovers, I place a mic cover on the Samson Go Mic, then use an elastic band to hang the pop filter on top. This is not the best audio protection available, but it is the most minimalistic and space-efficient gear for traveling. The mic cover can also be used on the rare occasion that I record audio with the Zoom H1.

GEAR I USE FOR CHARGING ON-THE-GO:
Anker Mini PowerBank ‚ñ∫ 
Silicone Cables ‚ñ∫ 
Adapter for Micro to Mini ‚ñ∫  
Adapter for Micro to Lightning ‚ñ∫ 
EXPLANATION: Anker's lipstick-sized powerbanks are small yet powerful. I travel with two, so that if one has a low charge, I can charge it in my hotel while I'm out and about with the other powerbank. Using the powerbank in conjunction with the short, durable silicone cables and micro/mini/lightning adapters means I can charge just about any device while on-the-go.

429,i20e5TQZZ6k,"INCREDIBLE INDIAN FOOD in DUBAI, Tour of Bur Dubai | Pulao, Vada Pav, INDIAN STREET FOOD","Dubai is having a reputation as a pricey destination but it‚Äôs also a amazing place to get cheap street food and traditional fare. 
When it comes to where to eat in Dubai, Bur Dubai neighbourhood is one of my best choice. The area is home to some of Dubai‚Äôs cheapest eats specialising in Pakistani, Persian, Arabic a Nepalese, Chinese, and Indian regional cuisines
For those who don't know, Bur Dubai is a historic district in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, located on the western side of the Dubai Creek. The name literally translates to Mainland Dubai, a reference to the traditional separation of the Bur Dubai area from Deira by the Dubai Creek.
Bur Dubai is known for having many shopping streets and souqs (or souk), including the textile souq near the abra boat station, gold souq, spice souq etc.
Bur dubai old souq in Dubai is probably the best bargain district in Dubai, it is an Arabic inspired market-theme and had wooden decorated entrance to the covered shopping area.
In this video, Myself, Ivan Cosmin and my wife, Nicolle (The Food Seekers) we are going for Indian food in Bur Dubai, trying some amazing  Indian food.
We cross the Creek via Abra and we reached the spice market. 
We were eager to try a refreshing sugarcane juice so we went to the sugarcane juice guy and watch him operate an juice machine that takes in one sugarcane at a time and pushes out beautiful green coloured cane juice that isn't just sweet and delicious, but also extremely nourishing and considered to be a real goldmine of health according to doctors and nutritionists.
On our way through Old Souq, we have our first Indian street snack. Nothing is labelled and there aren't any prices, but tell them what you want and they'll cheerfully make you a grab bag of treats to eat on the run.  We paid for a small bag 10 AED, and it was enought for two.  
We went to the dining room to taste also a tea, called ""Chai Karak""originated in India, which it means ""strong tea."" It is a very popular milk tea in, United Arab Emirates, Iran, and many other Arabic Gulf areas.  

Here are the addresses for the food locations we tried in Dubai:
      1) Indian Snacks ‚Äì Old Souq, Bur Dubai
      2) Vada Pav ‚Äì Vaibhav Vegetarian Restaurant, Fahidi Street Bur Dubai

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About The Food Seekers 

My name is Ivan Cosmin and together with my wife Nicolle we decided to share our love for good and tasty food while we are hanging around Dubai. 
Dubai is a food lover‚Äôs paradise so we consider ourselves lucky because we  currently living in Dubai.
We are planning to seek for new places where to eat the best food not only in Dubai but in the world.

Bunny Chow Curry Review - Eating South African Indian Food in Cape Town, South Africa Travel Food Video Transcript:

Alright guys, it is time for another food video from Cape Town. Today we're at the Eastern Food Bazaar. I apologize if it is a little bit loud here. The music is just like blasting. But anyways, we're going to introduce you to a dish called Bunny Chow. And we first had Bunny Chow when we came to South Africa about two years ago on safari. It is actually a curry so it is a hollowed out loaf of bread stuffed with curry and this is a dish that actually originated in Durban where there is a large Indian population.

So yeah, I think it is time to dig in shall we?

So Sam is going to do the honors. First up. Yeah, so first up I am having the chicken bunny chow and before I have that I'll point out that the one you got is vegetarian and there was also lamb on the menu. So yeah, lots of options.

Lots of options and just look at how big this is. This is my hand. It is seriously like half a loaf of bread. Right there.

So I'm just going to dig right in. I'm going to try and get. Oh, wow look at that.

Nice big piece of chicken. I'm going to try and get a little bit of bread and try to get a bit of chicken. Should that piece of chicken is so big I think I'm just going to go for some sauce.

Oh la lah.

Oh, that is nice. Yeah? Oh yeah? It smells so good. I can smell the curry. That is a wonderful curry. It is rich it is a little bit spicy but not overpoweringly spicy and it kind of reminds me a bit of a masala. Of a masala curry. It has just kind of got that rich tomato base. Yeah. Oh my gosh that is good. I'm going in for a second bite.

You know it is good when I go in for round two. And I did get a little bit of bread from the side as well. Cool.

Mmmmm.

Oh yeah. That is so good. Loving the bunny chow. And how often do we get to have a meal inside of a bread basket? I know. It is so cool. It is so cool. Look, I'm ripping off a piece of bread.

Mmmmm.

This is awesome.

It is now my turn so I got the vegetarian bunny chow. And here is the bread that was hollowed out from inside the loaf. So I'm going to use this for dipping.

So here we go. I should mention if you compare yours is more of a brown color.

Whereas mine is orange. So yours should taste different.

That is good. How is that? It is good. Woah. I'm spraying everywhere.

We've got some lentils, potatoes, green beans. Not lentils. I mean peas.

It burns in the throat. Yours is obviously spicier than mine. Mine is spicy but just kind of mildly spicy.

This is such a fun meal as well. Like look at this. I have a tower of bread on my plate. Like how often do you eat out of a tower of bread?

Not very. Mmmm.

That is good.

Oh, I should mention it comes with like a coleslaw type of salad on the side. You're going to try that?

I've got the chicken and I've got the bread. Bunny chow!

Bunny chow in Cape Town, South Africa. Mmmm.

So yeah, anyways moving on to price point. So that came to 90 Rand in total. The vegetarian one was 40 whereas the chicken one was 50. So you're talking what was it $6 dollars and something?

Yeah, $6.60. Six dollars and sixty cents so incredible value and the thing I really like about this particular place is that it is a very local spot. You can see that there is a lot of locals eating here.

I mean obviously there is tourists as well but the prices reflect you know a fair price for a local as well. Yeah, and you can find it in Cape Town but your best bet is going to be the city of Durban. Durban.

So yeah anyways signing out from Cape Town, South Africa.

This is part of our Travel in South Africa video series showcasing South African food, South African culture and South African cuisine.",Food

453,TnG50qxxlQ,How to Use Cardamom | Indian Food,"Watch more How to Cook Indian Food videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/500372-...



Cardamom is one of the most valuable spices in the world. Vanilla and Saffron being the other two most expensive spices. It's grown in southern India. Grows in little pods that are dried. These are green Cardamom pods which have a nice, almost sort of camphor, sweet smell to them. There's green Cardamom. There's white Cardamom pods, which are simply bleached green pods. And then there are black Cardamom pods, which have a kind of a hairy husk on them. And they are a little stronger. Stronger tasting. Have a kind of smoky taste as well. And Cardamom is also sold in a ground form, which is convenient to use. But it loses its intensity after a while.

The best way to work with Cardamom is to, you want to crack open the pods. You really don't eat the husk. What you want these lovely little seeds. There's about ten or 20 seeds. You can see one of them there. Cardamom's the feature in most Indian sweets and puddings. I think of it as the Vanilla of India, because it's so commonly used in all of their deserts. It has a little heat to its flavor too. So it works well in savory dishes as well as sweet dishes.

You'll find it meat curries, you'll find it in biryanis, which are the rice casseroles, and you'll find it in rice pilafs. You'll probably want to take the Cardamom pods out if you've put them whole into your rice dish. Because to chew on them, it's a little bit of a sharp bite. Although, Indians like to use Cardamom pods as a kind of breath freshener. They'll just chew on them and they do have a kind of minty heat to them. 

Cardamom has a really lovely flavor. And if you want the most intensity from your Cardamom, then I recommend you buy the whole pods, and grind them yourself.",Food

468,RFSUKLiP8,Allauddin's Briyani - MUST-EAT Singapore Indian Food at Tekka Centre!,"Allauddin's Chicken Briyani in Singapore is fragrant and delicious!
‚ñ∫SINGAPORE FOOD GUIDE: 
‚ñ∫SINGAPORE TRAVEL GUIDE: 

If you‚Äôre looking for excellent Indian hawker food in Singapore, one of the best places to go is Tekka Centre, located in Little India. You‚Äôll find a tempting variety of different Indian food stalls to choose from, many of them serving south Indian dishes. You can get paratha, banana leaf rice and curry, and what I chose to eat was chicken biryani from a famous stall called Allauddin‚Äôs. 

But before beginning with my chicken biryani, I first had an onion paratha, a greasy and crispy pieces of fried bread filled with onions and served with a side of curry sauce. It was pretty good. But nothing compared to my plate of chicken biryani. The rice was fluffy and fragrant, and not too dry, but had some nice moisture to it. The chicken was incredible - it was soft, yet not mushy at all, but remained a fantastic silky texture. Finally, the curry sauce that my plate of biryani was served with is what really elevated the plate to the next level.

For a wonderful plate of chicken biryani in Singapore, head over to Allauddin's Chicken Biryani at Tekka Centre.

Today I met up with my friend Sparsh, and we headed on out on a Indian food and dessert tour. We first started with Chole Bathure and Gulab Jamun at OM Corner. 

From there we headed to Gulabo one of the most famous sweets shops in Delhi. Here we tried Karachi Halwa, Motichoor Ladoo, White Rashbari, Rajbjog and Milk Ladoo. They were all extremely delicious and so different from western sweets!

Next up we visited the Humayun's Tomb. This is the tomb of the Mughal Emperor Humayun and was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress Bega Begum in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas, a Persian architect chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb to be built in India!

We then visited Lodhi Gardens to see three different tombs. When we got there we had to try Bhel Puri a Mumbai dish, it was fantastic!

For lunch we headed to Kulcha Junction to eat Amritsari Kulcha from the city of Amritsar. Basically bread with different fillings and chickpeas. So delicious! 

Lastly we stopped in Connaught Place to eat Fire Paan. It's probably the most unique food experience you can have in Delhi!

Malaysian Street Food - Malaysian Food - Kuala Lumpur Street Food
Malaysian Street Food in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia is the best! A multicultural display of extremely delicious specialty food is available for eating. Within Malaysian street food, there is Malay Street food, Chinese Street Food, and Indian street food all available to try and the options are endless. Kuala Lumpur street food is some of the best in the world. Street food around the world is different everywhere, but what is so special about Malaysia is how multicultural everything is and how unique the cooking and food culture is. So for my 3rd trip to Malaysia, we came for a Kuala Lumpur food tour. Chuchu and I decided to travel to Malaysia on a 4 day eating vacation to eat as much street food and local specialties as we could. 

One thing that we both fell in love with about Malaysian cuisine, is that you could really spend a lifetime eating here tasting the local varieties of Chinese food, Indian Food, and Malay Food.

Our first stop of the day was the Kyani & Co Cafe, a legendary Irani bakery, it was established in 1904! We had some Bun Muska and Chai to start. Then we had Egg Bhurjee Pav which is eggs with spices and some bread. 

Next we headed to the Gateway of India and from there we hopped on a 1 hour ferry ride to Elephanta Island. This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is dedicated to Lord Shiva. This is the #1 day trip to take from Mumbai, India.

We then hit up the Colaba Market to see if we can find some souvenirs. I personally didn't love it because there wasn't anything of quality. I really wanted a mask but there wasn't any. 

On the way to lunch we passed Marine Drive, which is the seafront area of Mumbai. It is called the Queen's necklace because at night from the sky it resembles a Queen's pearl necklace.

For lunch we ate Maharashtrian Indian Food fit for a king! We first tried Thalipeeth which is Indian pancakes. Next up is Kothimbir Vadi which was like a veggy burger, soooo good! 

The next place was Sabudana Vada which is small white balls and the last dish was Misal Pav which is a spicy curry with potatoes and eaten with bread. To end the meal we had a smooth creamy Lassi!

We ended our tour at the Mahalakshmi Temple, one of the most famous temples in all of Mumbai!

I hope you loved this Maharashtrian Indian Food and the Elephanta Caves on Elephanta Island! Please like this video, leave me a comment and subscribe to my channel!

Mango Curry Ingredients:
4 large, very ripe and juicy MANGOES
1 cup YOGURT
1-2 Tbsp CUMIN SEEDS
dash of ASAFOETIDA
¬º cup CURRY LEAVES chopped well
4-5 Tbsp GINGER finely chopped
2-3 Tbsp CHICKPEA FLOUR a.k.a. besan
2 Tbsp OIL for cooking
SALT to taste

Mango Curry Directions: 
Use super-duper ripe mangoes.  The mangoes should be VERY RIPE, soft and juicy.
Peel and pit the mangoes and place the fruit in a bowl. Crush the mango with your hands until it's a wet, semi-lumpy mess.
Add in about 1 cup of Greek-style yogurt and mix well.
In a large pot, heat oil on medium high heat. 
Add cumin seeds and asafoetida and cook 30-40 seconds.
Add curry leaves, half of the ginger, and chickpea flour.  Stir and continue cooking about 2 minutes.  
Add mango mixture and 1 cup of water and stir well with ingredients in pot.
Bring to a bubble, the reduce the heat, cover and let simmer about 10 minutes.
Stir occasionally and add more water as desired.
After 10 minutes, add the remaining ginger, cover and let cook another 5 minutes.
That's it! Serve over rice, dude.

Chana Masala Ingredients:
1 15 oz can CHICKPEAS (or 2 cups)
1 15 oz can DICED TOMATOES (or 2 fresh diced)
1 tsp GARLIC (minced)
1 tsp GINGER (minced)
1 HOT PEPPER (minced)
1-2 Tbsp OLIVE OIL
1 Tbsp CHICK PEA FLOUR (also called besan)
1 tsp CUMIN SEEDS
1 tsp CHILI POWDER
1 tsp GARAM MASALA
1/8 tsp ASAFOETIDA (optional, also called hing)
¬Ω tsp TURMERIC
SALT (to taste)

In a skillet, heat oil on medium high heat. When the oil is heated, add the cumin seeds and asafoetida. Stir and allow to simmer for just a few moments. Once the seeds begin to crack, add the chick pea flour and continue stirring. The flour will absorb the oil. Stir for approx. 1 minute and then add the diced tomatoes. Mix well and allow the tomatoes to bubble. As the tomatoes cook down, you can crush them with your stirrer for a smoother chana masala. Add the minced ginger and garlic and hot pepper. Add the chili powder and turmeric. After the tomatoes have cooked 4-5 minutes, add the chick peas, garam masala, and salt to taste. Mix well and add 1 cup of water. Bring the dish to a bubble, then reduce to a simmer, cover, and allow cooking for 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes, the chick peas will be soft. Use a fork or potato masher to smash some of the chick peas, this will help thicken the chana masala along with the chick pea flour added earlier. Simmer uncovered to the desired consistency, remove and serve. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Serve with rice or on its own.

492,WoAvXV4lPZ0,How to Make a Mango Lassi | Indian Food,"Watch more How to Cook Indian Food videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/500351-...

Lassi is a popular drink in the north. Plain lassi is made with yogurt and sugar with crushed ice and a few drops if rose water. To make this sweet version, I use mango pulp sold at Indian or Hispanic grocery stores and yogurt without stabilizers from health food stores. 1/2 cup mango pulp 2 cups plain yogurt 1 cup water 2 tablespoons sugar In a blender combine mango pulp, yogurt, water, and sugar and blend for 30 seconds until well blended and slightly foamy.

Hi, today I'm going to teach you how to make a mango lassi. Lassis are a refreshing Indian drink made with yogurt. They're a mixture of yogurt and fruit or yogurt and salt. Today we're going to make a sweet one, a sweet mango one. We're going to add two cups of plain yogurt and we're going to add half a cup of mango pulp. Now, there's different kinds of mango pulp you can find at an Indian grocery store. There's alphonso mangos and kesar mangos, just different varieties of the fruit. I prefer alphonso mango. It's got a very rich, full, lovely balanced flavor so if you can find that I highly recommend it.

I'm adding two tablespoons of sugar. You can sweeten it to taste. Actually, I'll put in a little extra. It's up to you. I like it a little bit sweet. And I'm going to add some water and this also is variable depending on what consistency you like. And we're just going to mix this up until it gets really nice and frothy. 

Okay. This looks like a nice consistency and I'm going to pour it over ice so it's nice and cold. This tastes great on a hot Indian afternoon. And I'm going to garnish it with just a little sprig of mint and there is your mango lassi. Yummy.",Food

...Because it's an ASMR video ^_^. Some people find eating sounds and whispering relaxing.

Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) is a neologism for a perceptual phenomenon characterized as a distinct, pleasurable tingling sensation in the head, scalp, back, or peripheral regions of the body in response to visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or cognitive stimuli.

Established in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad remained under the rule of the Qutb Shahi dynasty for nearly a century before the Mughals captured the region. In 1724, Mughal viceroy Asif Jah I declared his sovereignty and created his own dynasty, known as the Nizams of Hyderabad.

Hyderabadi cuisine comprises a broad repertoire of rice, wheat and meat dishes and the skilled use of various spices.  Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem, with their blend of Mughlai and Arab cuisines, carry the national Geographical Indications tag. Hyderabadi cuisine is influenced to some extent by French, but more by Arabic, Turkish, Iranian and native Telugu and Marathwada cuisines.

Popular native dishes is ""Double Ka Meetha"" which is covered in this Vlog.

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel vlog channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! I travel and make daily travel vlogs so you can travel with me. Subscribe if you like to travel! 

When I'm not traveling you can hang out with me in my home town Amsterdam. So if you always wanted to travel in Amsterdam this is the place to be to get an insight in the local life without actually having to travel. Enjoy!

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. Have been living in Amsterdam for over 5 years.

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?

GAURAV‚ÄôS CHANNEL - 

The street food culture in India is one of the most vibrant and unique scenes you can find in the world. But beyond street food, you can learn about the people and culture through other means, like we did in this video. Join us for a special episode where we introduce one of the most prominent Gurudwara‚Äôs in India, and learn about Sikhism and the importance of langar in Indian communities. 

Gurudwara‚Äôs are places of worship for Sikhs, however anyone is welcome to the Gurudwara regardless of their religion, ethnicity, gender, etc‚Ä¶ The Darbar Sahib (scriptures) is the centrepiece in every Gurudwara, and the scriptures are sung and explained inside the Gurudwara, so that everyone can learn. At Gurudwara Bangla Sahib, the main hall is beautifully decorated and the music is fantastic. 

Another essential component of Gurudwaras, is the langar. Langar is a community kitchen and meal. The meal is always vegetarian and is always free. Members of the community from different backgrounds join together in the langar hall to eat the same meal together. The Gurudwara may see between 10,000 or 100,000 people in a day. In this video, we show you the hard work that is put in by the Sikh community every single day to feed those coming into the Gurudwara. This experience was humbling and wonderful, and we are so thankful for this opportunity. We would like to extend our thanks to the members of Gurudwara Bangla Sahib for welcoming us in and teaching about Sikhism, Gurudwara and langar. We would also like to give a huge thank you to Gaurav for making this happen and sharing this experience with us! 

We hope you learned something new and enjoyed coming on this journey with us! If you enjoyed it, please let us know in the comments!

541,Kb9pNl1IQpY,"PAPER DOSA, INDIAN FOOD, HUGE PAPER DOSA MADE IN AN INDIAN FOOD RESTAURANT","PAPER DOSA, INDIAN FOOD, HUGE PAPER DOSA MADE IN AN INDIAN FOOD RESTAURANT, Dosa is a type of pancake made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe but its main ingredients are rice and black gram. Dosa is a typical part of the South Indian diet and popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, Dosa is served hot along with sambar, stuffing of potatoes or paneer and chutney. It can be consumed with idli podi as well.  Dosa is indigenous to South India; its exact birthplace in that region is a matter of conjecture.[1] According to food historian K. T. Achaya, dosa (as dosai) was already in use in ancient Tamil country around the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature.[2] According to P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the Udupi town of present-day Karnataka.[3]

In popular tradition, the origin of dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with the Udupi restaurants.[1] Also, the original Tamil dosa was softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa, which became popular all over India, was first made in present-day Karnataka.[4] A recipe for dosa (as dosaka) can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.[5]  Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or saturated fats. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it is also a good source of protein.[7] The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.[8] There are also instant mix products for making dosa which usually contain higher amounts of rice.

Preparation[edit]
File:Dosa preparation.ogv
Dosa making
A mixture of rice and black grams that has been soaked in water is ground finely to form a batter. Some add a handful of fenugreek seeds soaked along with the rice. The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 4:1 or 5:1. The batter is allowed to ferment overnight. After the overnight fermentation, the batter is mixed with water to get the desired thickness. The batter is then ladled onto a hot tava (griddle) greased with oil or ghee (clarified butter). It is spread out evenly with the base of a ladle or bowl to form a pancake. A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is also usually served with chutney and sambar. The mixture of black grams and rice can be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina. Dosa can be stuffed with fillings of vegetables and sauces to make a quick meal. They are typically served with a vegetarian side dish which varies according to regional and personal preferences. Common side items are:

Sambar
Wet chutney: examples include coconut chutney (a semisolid paste made up of coconut, dal (lentils), green chilli and mint or coriander)
There are variety of chutney served along with Dosai[9]
Dry chutney (Idli podi or molagapodi): a powder of spices and sometimes desiccated coconut

Indian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines native to India. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic group and occupations, these cuisines vary significantly from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religious and cultural choices and traditions. There has also been Central Asian influence on North Indian cuisine from the years of Mughal rule. Indian cuisine has been and is still evolving, as a result of the nation's cultural interactions with other societies.

Historical incidents such as foreign invasions, trade relations and colonialism have also played a role in introducing certain foods to the country. For instance, the potato, a staple of the Indian diet, was brought to India by the Portuguese, who also introduced chillies and breadfruit. Indian cuisine has also shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe is often cited by historians as the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. It has also influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Southeast Asia, the British Isles, Fiji, and the Caribbean.",Food
