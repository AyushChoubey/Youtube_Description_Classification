Street Food in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro!    

Ever since I first learned about the city of Rio de Janeiro when I was a kid growing up, I have wanted to visit. Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we’ll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited.

Here’s the Brazilian food and things we did:

Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He’s not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you’re in Rio de Janeiro, you don’t want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: ), sets up in the morning about 7 am.

Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.

Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn’t going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.

Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: 

Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.

Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar).

Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you’ll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that’s famous for serving empada de camarão (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: 

Bar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: 

Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location:  Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.

Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.

The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. 

A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city’s iconic peak, and try not to look down – it’s a long way to drop!

After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. 

The “Cidade Maravilhosa,” or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?

Travel video about destination Brazil.
Brazil is a country of both the superlative and also amazing contrast, with dynamic metropolises, cultural centres and untouched nature. It is the largest country on the South American Continent.We begin our journey in Rio De Janeiro, the secret capital of Brazil, a veritable firework display of unashamed joie de vivre, football, samba and religion. The focal point of today’s Rio is the monumental glass cone of the Catedral Metropolitana that  measures eighty metres high and looks like a Mexican pyramid. The Rua Do Ouvidor, with its elegant old buildings and splendid shops, is a reminder of the city’s historical and commercial importance. Portuguese settlers founded the city and sugar cane and gold made Rio’s colonial rulers extremely rich. In former times the coastal towns were protected by fortresses and canons. Paraty was one of those romantic locations, south of Rio on the Costa Verde, a gem dating back to Brazil’s colonial times. Around five hundred kilometres north of Rio and deep within the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, is a most remarkable place. Ouro Preto was discovered at the end of the seventeenth century by Portuguese gold prospectors who discovered ‘black gold’ that changed colour due to its iron content. São Paulo is one of the mega cities of the twenty first century and with a population of twenty million it is the economic heart of Brazil. The railway helped to transport cotton and later coffee, and its large station, with British-designed clock tower, became an important  symbol. Brazil is synonymous with sunshine, samba and exotic nature, a dream destination full of both adventure and constant fun!

Travel Videos HD,  World Travel Guide 
Brazil is the largest country in South America and fifth largest in the world. Famous for its football (soccer) tradition and its annual Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Recife and Olinda. It is a country of great diversity, from the bustling urban mosaic of São Paulo to the infinite cultural energy of Pernambuco and Bahia, the wilderness of the Amazon rainforest and world-class landmarks such as the Iguaçu Falls, there is plenty to see and to do in Brazil.

See in Brazil
=========
Amazon Rainforest - The Amazon River Basin holds more than half of the world's remaining rainforest, and over 60% of that lies within the North of Brazil — approximately one billion acres with incredible biodiversity. The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, over 40,000 plants species, 2200 fish species, and more than 2,000 types of birds and mammals. One in five of all the bird species in the world live in the rainforests of the Amazon, and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams. 

Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlântica) - A region of tropical and subtropical forest which extends along the Atlantic coast of Brazil from Rio Grande do Norte state in the Northeast to Rio Grande do Sul state in the South. The Atlantic Forest has a wide variety of vegetation, including the many tree species such as the iconic araucaria tree in the south or the mangroves of the northeast, dozens of types of bromeliads and orchids, and unique critters such as capivara. The forest has also been designated a World Biosphere Reserve, with a large number of highly endangered species including the well-known marmosets, lion tamarins and woolly spider monkeys. Unfortunately, it has been extensively cleared since colonial times, mainly for the farming of sugar cane and for urban settlements — The remnants are estimated to be less than 10% of the original, and that is often broken into hilltop islands. However, large swaths of it are protected by hundreds of parks, including 131 federal parks, 443 state parks, and 14 municipal parks, most of which are open to visitation.

Campos Gerais - With a vast vegetation of grasses and areas of transition between the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, this region offers beautiful scenery of cliffs and canyons, as Jaguaricatú Valley, beyond the fifth and the eighth most extensive canyons in the world, which are respectively Guartelá and Jaguariaíva . Jaguariaíva the canyon is made more beautiful rafting activity in Brazil.

Pantanal - A vast tropical wetland expanse, one of the world's largest. 80% of it lies within the state of Mato Grosso do Sul but it also extends into Mato Grosso (as well as into portions of Bolivia and Paraguay), sprawling over an area estimated at between 140,000 and 195,000 square kilometers (54,000-75,000 sq mi). 80% of the Pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons, nurturing an astonishing biologically diverse collection of aquatic plants and helping support a dense array of animal species.

Waterfalls (Cachoeiras) - Brazil has an amazing range of impressive waterfalls of all sizes and shapes. Iguaçu Falls, in eastern Parana, is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world, truly a sight to see. The 353-meter Cachoeira da Fumaça in Bahia's Chapada Diamantina National Park is the country's second highest waterfall, after the Amazon's almost inaccessible Cachoeira do Araca. Other famous waterfalls include Caracol Falls, in a Rio Grande do Sul state park of the same name near Canela, Itaquira Falls, an easily accessible 168-meter fall near Formosa, Goiás, and the gorge at Parque da Cascata near Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais. Aside from the nationally famous falls, in many parts of the country, particularly the South, Southeast, and Central West regions, you are rarely far from at least one locally-famous, named waterfall worth a short hike.

Architecture
------------------
Colonial architecture - Many cities have reminders of Brazil's colonial past, with churches, monasteries, forts, barracks, and other structures still intact. Some of the most concentrated and best-preserved colonial buildings can be found in old gold-mining towns such as Ouro Preto and Tiradentes, but many other cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Petrópolis, Salvador, Recife, Paraty, and Goiânia have quite significant colonial centers as well.

Oscar Niemeyer works - Niemeyer, Brazil's most famous architect, is a modern architectural pioneer who explores the aesthetic impact of reinforced concrete, using curves to create buildings with a unique sense of space.",travel

The Atlantic Forest has a wide variety of vegetation, including the many tree species such as the iconic araucaria tree in the south or the mangroves of the northeast, dozens of types of bromeliads and orchids, and unique critters such as capivara. The forest has also been designated a World Biosphere Reserve, with a large number of highly endangered species including the well-known marmosets, lion tamarins and woolly spider monkeys. Unfortunately, it has been extensively cleared since colonial times, mainly for the farming of sugar cane and for urban settlements — The remnants are estimated to be less than 10% of the original, and that is often broken into hilltop islands. However, large swaths of it are protected by hundreds of parks, including 131 federal parks, 443 state parks, and 14 municipal parks, most of which are open to visitation.

Campos Gerais - With a vast vegetation of grasses and areas of transition between the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, this region offers beautiful scenery of cliffs and canyons, as Jaguaricatú Valley, beyond the fifth and the eighth most extensive canyons in the world, which are respectively Guartelá and Jaguariaíva . Jaguariaíva the canyon is made more beautiful rafting activity in Brazil.

Pantanal - A vast tropical wetland expanse, one of the world's largest. 80% of it lies within the state of Mato Grosso do Sul but it also extends into Mato Grosso (as well as into portions of Bolivia and Paraguay), sprawling over an area estimated at between 140,000 and 195,000 square kilometers (54,000-75,000 sq mi). 80% of the Pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons, nurturing an astonishing biologically diverse collection of aquatic plants and helping support a dense array of animal species.

Waterfalls (Cachoeiras) - Brazil has an amazing range of impressive waterfalls of all sizes and shapes. Iguaçu Falls, in eastern Parana, is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world, truly a sight to see. The 353-meter Cachoeira da Fumaça in Bahia's Chapada Diamantina National Park is the country's second highest waterfall, after the Amazon's almost inaccessible Cachoeira do Araca. Other famous waterfalls include Caracol Falls, in a Rio Grande do Sul state park of the same name near Canela, Itaquira Falls, an easily accessible 168-meter fall near Formosa, Goiás, and the gorge at Parque da Cascata near Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais. Aside from the nationally famous falls, in many parts of the country, particularly the South, Southeast, and Central West regions, you are rarely far from at least one locally-famous, named waterfall worth a short hike.",travel
15,Xk5-2u0kw0,Sao Paulo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"São Paulo, one of the world’s most populated cities, is Brazil’s exciting hub of business, culture, creativity and hospitality.

‘Sampa’ was founded in 1554, at the spot of the historic Pátio do Colégio. Once home to the region’s first main Catholic Church, the central Praça da Sé now houses the towering Metropolitan Cathedral. 

Two beautiful historic buildings have been transformed into Cultural Centers: The Banco do Brazil and the Júlio Prestes Train Station. While the city’s most esteemed museums are the São Paulo Museum of Art, on the famous Avenida Paulista, and the Pinacoteca do Estado. 

The Viaduto Santa Ifigenia, an art nouveau bridge, leads pedestrians to the ornate Municipal Theatre, with its impressive Sala São Paulo concert hall.

Don’t miss Ibirapuera Park, which is home to the modern Ibirapuera Auditorium, the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art and the Afro Brazil Museum.

Meet Brazil’s soccer heroes through the interactive exhibits of the Football Museum in Pacaembu Stadium. Nearby, Vila Madalena is a bohemian district with quirky stores, funky cafés and colorful street art.

In the Mercado Municipal, tourists gather to taste the local cuisine while the Paulistanos bargain for fresh produce and gourmet food.

Explore all of São Paulo’s neighborhoods and bustling cultural hubs to discover that this city is not only the engine behind Brazil’s economy, but also its cultural powerhouse.

My goal was to live in Rio de Janeiro, travel around the country, participate in Carnaval, and somehow work at the FIFA World Cup.

Through many setbacks and roadblocks, I managed to meet a lot of great Brazilian people who helped me accomplish these goals over the course of a year living in Brazil.

It was most definitely one of the greatest experiences of my life.

RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL - Food in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro!   

Favela - An unregulated, informal neighborhood in Brazil. There are estimates of as many as 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many of the favelas in Rio de Janeiro are full cities within themselves, where nearly everything is available.

It’s without a doubt that a lot of crime and organized underground criminal activity happens and is controlled in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. However, favelas across Brazil are home to some of the most hard working, friendly, happy, and creative people in Brazil as well. So in this video my goal was to meet and to highlight some of the amazing people that call favelas home. 

Rocinha - The first favela we visited was Rocinha, the biggest favela in Rio, one of the biggest in Brazil. We met up with Guilherme who took us on a walking tour to some viewpoints and to some Brazilian food places.

Sabor da Roça - The most well known little snack shop on this street in Rocinha, we stopped for a coxinha, one of the top Brazilian food snacks. It was packed with chicken and with some hot sauce it was amazing. 
Price -  2.5 BRL ($0.63)

For lunch we stopped at an alleyway restaurant in Rocinha, where he cooked up a lunch set included beef ribs, cassava, pasta, rice, and beans. It was simple, but delicious and hearty.
Price - 10 BRL ($2.52)

Morro da Providência - Favela number two is one of the first favelas of Rio and located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, near the port and up on a hill on the side of the cliff. We met up with Jura, who is an absolute Brazilian food cooking legend and an amazing person.

One of Jura’s most famous dishes is nhoque de camarão, an Italian but Brazilian potato noodles in Jura’s own creation sauce of shrimp and coconut milk. It was simply outstanding, all made from scratch.

But the dish I was most interested in eating and which Jura expertly cooked, again from scratch was her feijoada - often considered the national dish of Brazil, and one of my personal favorite foods of Brazil as well - there are few dishes of the world more comforting than beans and pig parts with rice. When you’re in Brazil, you can eat feijoada at many restaurants, but home-cooked is by far the best.

Thank you Jura and Elena!!

This was one of the best days I had in Brazil in terms of learning, meeting people, and food, and it’s an experience and memories I’ll never forget. 

You hear a lot of the negative that comes out of favelas in Brazil, and it is true. However, the positive side and the amazing people, are not often recognized, and it was truly memorable to see and learn about this side of hope in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Huge thank you to Guilherme Camocardi and Rafa Ribs from Rio4Fun and Rio4Food. Check out their videos here:

35,fnKcEZL9Wg,"Rio De Janeiro, Brazil: Cost of Living 4K","Even with all the non-stop travel, our Passport Heavy crew never found  ourselves in Rio De Janeiro Brazil…until now. And what an experience it was! A city bursting at the seams with culture, food, dope views, beautiful people, amazing beaches, plenty of activities and deep history, Rio De Janeiro sure is a city worth experiencing.

We were naturally on edge after hearing all the stories of how dangerous parts of Rio De Janeiro are, but similarly to Chicago or New York, the danger is a bit overhyped. There may be dangerous parts in the city, but believing the city is dangerous takes away from all the other amazing experiences in the city.

We had an incredible time in the city, and would like to thank the city of Rio De Janeiro for having us, and letting us experience Brazil. Enjoy this Passport Heavy Cost of Living guide to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.

In this Brazil travel vlog, you will learn from the expert. I grew up coming here every year and will teach you the inside tips about downtown Buzios, including the nightlife. You will see 'Rua das Pedras', 'Orla Bardot', and 'Praia da Armação' - day and night.

In this trip to Brazil, I also visited Cabo Frio, a nearby city. Watch it here:

More details about what you see in this Brazil travel vlog:

► Buzios: The official name of the city is 'Armação dos Búzios', but everyone just refers to it as 'Búzios'. This is a beach community in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and a popular getaway for Brazilians and Argentinians. Basically an unknown fishing village until the 1960s, it was made famous by French actress Brigitte Bardot. 

► Rua das Pedras: Translating, the name means stones' street, and that's exactly what you'll see. More than that, it's Buzios' main street, with an active nightlife and a nice variety of shopping and restaurants.

► Orla Bardot:  Named after Brigitte Bardot, this is the strip of land that connects Praia da Armação with Rua das Pedras, the main street in town. Brigitte Bardot is also honored along the oceanfront path with a bronze statue.

► Praia da Armação: This beach is located downtown, next to Rua das Pedras and in front of Orla Bardot. To this date, it is still full of fishing boats. Their old houses have been restored and are now lovely restaurants and pousadas. From this beach, you can get the boat tours to the various other beaches in Buzios.

► WHO AM I?

I am a Brazilian journalist living in the United States. After traveling the world working with sports, news, and events for over 15 years, I realized that what I really love is the travel part of it all. So I exchanged the life in the newsrooms and stadiums for the daily challenge of being an independent content producer. 

I created this channel to share the beauties of the world... stuff that for so long I only kept to myself. Also to help people planning similar trips and to inspire more people to venture out and enjoy life!

P.S.: The guy who occasionally appears in the vlogs is my husband, Gordon. He is Canadian-American and is extremely shy, that's why he's behind the camera most of the time ;)

This video covers the Don'ts of Visiting Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
Filmed in Sao Paulo State, Brazil
Copyright Mark Wolters 2017 
1. Don't expect to get anywhere quickly in Sao Paulo. With so many people, cars and craziness it will take you longer than what google says it will to get anywhere. 
2. Don't skip the Mercado Municipal! This Sao Paulo tradition is amazing. From amazing fruit to the best bologna or sorry Mortadella sandwich you ever ate. 
3. Don't skip out on eating non-Brazilian food while in Sao Paulo. There are tons of amazing places, foods, restaurants and styles for you to enjoy! 
4. Don't lose your wits. Pay attention! Sao Paulo has a reputation for crime for a reason. 
5. Don't expect a beach vacation. Sao Paulo is not a Brazilian beach city, it is a cultural, shopping, museum, business hub for South America.

45,EFIKeRrrloQ,Ilha Grande Bay Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/Ilha-Grande-B...

Brazil’s Costa Verde is an incredible ribbon of coastline between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Here the emerald jungles of the Serra do Mar plunge into the Atlantic in spectacular fashion, but nowhere more so, than at Ilha Grande Bay. 
 
Just a two-hour bus ride from the non-stop-energy of Rio, Ilha Grande Bay offers rhythms that are in total tune with nature. Once here, you’ll find yourself caring less about finding the perfect Wi-Fi signal, and more about connections of a deeper kind.
 
One hundred miles to the southwest of Rio is the historic port town of Angra dos Reis. Once slave ships unloaded human cargoes bound for the vast coffee plantations of the interior. Today the port is a popular escape for Rio’s harried locals. 
 
Once you’ve explored the town, there are endless beaches to enjoy, while offshore, over 350 islands are calling. Climb aboard a ferryboat or set sail on a schooner to the bay’s undisputed jewel, Ilha Grande. For much of last century, this incredible island was home to Brazil’s Alcatraz. What was once purgatory for the country’s most notorious felons is now heaven for nature lovers.
 
For those seeking the best kinds of treasures, Ilha Grande’s riches know no bounds.",travel
46,HH4i18UiMFE,Visit Brazil - Bus Travel in Brazil,"When traveling around Brazil be ready for the Buses! Here are some helpful tips for Bus Travel in Brazil. 
1. you can buy some tickets online, but without an official Brazilian government number you may not be able to buy tickets online. 
2. There are a number of bus companies in Brazil and they serve different destinations. Make sure you look for bus companies that specifically focus on travel to where you want to go. 
3. There are different levels of bus service in Brazil. The more you pay, the better the service. 
4. Always have your ticket with you, they check it multiple times. 
5. Keep all important stuff with you on the bus. Big backpacks go under the buy, but have a small day pack with your tickets, passport, snacks and drinks with you.
6. Bring screwtop bottles of drinks as the rides can get bumpy.
7. The buses are relatively on time, but do not push it with tight connections if you are looking to get a flight as traffic can be crazy in Brazil.

Our visit Rio De Janeiro travel guide documentary, before the Olympics of 2016, covers some of the top attractions including a food guide (best restaurants and street food), top museums and Rio at night. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities you won't find in a typical Rio De Janeiro tourism brochure or Rio De Janeiro, Brasil city tour.

25 Things to do in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Travel Guide and Top Attractions Transcript:

First up, we started with the city’s most iconic sight: Christ Redeemer. We boarded the train as soon as the station opened and made our way to the top of Corcovado Mountain. Sometimes the statue can be shielded by fog, but we lucked out with beautiful blue skies and panoramic views of the city as far as the eye could see. 

For a bit of colour, we headed over to the Selaron Steps, which is a tiled staircase created by Chilean artist, Jorge Selarón. Initially Selaron would scavenge construction sites looking for tiles, but in later years as his work gained notoriety, travellers began donating tiles.

Since we chose to stay in the neighbourhood of Ipanema, we ended up spending quite a bit of time at Ipanema Beach. We noticed that this beach was really popular for beach football, volleyball, and surfing. And of course, what makes this beach so iconic are its two mountains, known as Dois Irmãos. If you come here on a clear day, you can catch a killer sunset.

No visit to Rio de Janeiro would be complete without heading up Sugarloaf Mountain, so when the skies finally cleared that’s exactly what we did. We paid for our tickets and boarded the cable car for a somewhat unnerving ride up. If you’re scared of heights, this probably isn’t the attraction for you, however, if you manage to make it to the top you get some really cool panoramic views of Rio. 

Copacabana Beach is the most famed beach in all of Rio de Janeiro and if you were to visit on a weekend during the summer months you’d find that the place is packed beyond belief. We happened to be here in winter so things were a lot more relaxed, but that didn’t stop visitors from braving the waters. 

We did a  favela tour to Babilônia and Chapéu Mangueira. On our tour we saw lots of street art, learned about life inside a favela.

And that is a wrap! We hope this video will give you guys some ideas of things to do in Rio de Janeiro on your visit, and for those travellers who have already been there, feel free to add your suggestion of cool activities and attractions in the comments below.

This is part of our Travel in Brazil video series showcasing Brazilian food, Brazilian culture and Brazilian cuisine.

Welcome to my São Paulo Travel VLOG, it's been tough to leave Jericoacoara behind and coming into a vibrant city like São Paulo is a tough change. Loud noises, pollution and a ton of people are something completely different than the nature I experienced before in Jericoacoara.

There will be more videos from São Paulo, especially from the Brazilian Carnival. São Paulo should be on everybody's list if you're asking yourself - ""what to do in Brazil"". São Paulo has everything you want to offer, good food, culture, nightlife, street art and a ton more.

What to do in São Paulo in 3 days? Go explore, see where the journey takes you and enjoy the stay.

I spent 48 hours on the beautiful island of Floripa and made it my mission to experience as many of the 42 beaches as possible.

Thanks to the guidance and advice of local friends, I can definitely say, without reservation, that I found paradise. 

Best Beaches of Florianopolis: 

Campeche Beach - One of the widest and longest stretching beaches in Florianopolis.

Joaquina Beach - Famous for its big sand dunes and surfing breaks, Joaquina has long been the most popular beach in Floripa.

Mole Beach - In recent years, Mole beach is taking over Joaquina's thrown as the ultimate hot spot for the young, cool crowd. Come here to surf or hangout and stay for the beautiful women of Floripa!

Jureré / Jureré Internacional - This part of the island is dedicated to the rich and famous. Huge homes, beautiful beach and lots of money to go around. There is also a really cool fort close to Jureré Internacional that you should check out while you're in the area.

Santinho Beach - Off the beaten path and a little bit of a task getting there, Santinho is a great spot to escape the crowds. Although there's a big resort on one end of the beach, if you time it right you'll have more than enough space to enjoy the beauty of rolling green hills crashing down into the ocean.

Lagoinha do Leste - Absolute paradise. As you saw from the video, it takes a little while to get there, but that makes it all the better. Come during high season and you'll have to share the space with surfers... a small price to pay for perfection.

54,TOVlscESoag,Brazilian Food - 5 Foods You MUST EAT in Brazil,"Comida Brasileira, Brazilian Food! Brazil is full of delicious meats, fruits, and specialties. Here we go through six overall tasty treats you should have when you come to Brazil. The best of Brazilian food, so you know what to eat when you visit Brazil. 
1. The Lanches: the snacks like Pao de Quiejo (cheese bread), Coixinha do Frango (fried chicken dough ball), and such that go great with a Chop (draft beer) or a Caipirinha (the local Brazilian mixed drink), and if you don’t like alcohol the drink of brazil is Guarana. 
2. The Meats: Brazil is full of great meat and the most famous meats you will have at a Rodizio or Chrassasco. Here they walk around with many different types of meats from chicken hearts to ribs, but the most important is Picanha, a specific kind of Brazilian cut of meat. 
3. The Fruits: Brazil is full of amazing fruit and many you might not have heard of. Visit a market and try fruit you never saw before and have juices made fresh just for you. 
4. The Sweets: those fruits go well into many of the bolos (cakes) that are in Brazil, but if you want some chocolate have Brigadeiro, a chocolate made with sweetened condense milk. There are also traditional favorites like doce de leite (cream caramel) or doce de abobara (sweetness of pumpkin). 
5. The Local Dishes: each region in Brazil has its own specialities so make sure you are trying what is popular where you are. The south is famous for its beef. The northeast is great for seafood. Bahia has acaraje a bean paste taco kind of dish with shrimp inside. Sao Paulo has its own mortadella/bologna sandwich, or chicken cooked in its own blood in Minas Gerais. 
6. Beans and Rice: beans and rice will appear on the menu again and again and even if you didn’t order them expect beans and rice. They are a staple of the Brazilian food culture. Some typical dishes that highlight these are Caldo de Feijao which is a bean soup/stew dish you have as a starter. Feijoada which is the Brazilian bean stew you will have served with rice, kovi, fried banana and with a ice cold chop (beer).

Luckily my boyfriend watched the whole thing go down and was able to retrieve it back from him. Other than that I had an amazing workshop, enjoyed the beach and had so much fun at Macarana Stadium!

Street Food in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro!    

Ever since I first learned about the city of Rio de Janeiro when I was a kid growing up, I have wanted to visit. Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we’ll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited.

Here’s the Brazilian food and things we did:

Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He’s not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you’re in Rio de Janeiro, you don’t want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: ), sets up in the morning about 7 am.

Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.

Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn’t going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.

Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: 

Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.

Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar).

Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you’ll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that’s famous for serving empada de camarão (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: 

Bar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: 

Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location:  Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.

Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.

The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. 

A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city’s iconic peak, and try not to look down – it’s a long way to drop!

After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. 

The “Cidade Maravilhosa,” or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?

82,lshNdiTvNMI,Brazil (South-America) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"✱ 59/874 Hotels in Brazil - Lowest Price Guarantee ► https://booki.ng/2N3J1uI

Travel video about destination Brazil.
Brazil is a country of both the superlative and also amazing contrast, with dynamic metropolises, cultural centres and untouched nature. It is the largest country on the South American Continent.We begin our journey in Rio De Janeiro, the secret capital of Brazil, a veritable firework display of unashamed joie de vivre, football, samba and religion. The focal point of today’s Rio is the monumental glass cone of the Catedral Metropolitana that  measures eighty metres high and looks like a Mexican pyramid. The Rua Do Ouvidor, with its elegant old buildings and splendid shops, is a reminder of the city’s historical and commercial importance. Portuguese settlers founded the city and sugar cane and gold made Rio’s colonial rulers extremely rich. In former times the coastal towns were protected by fortresses and canons. Paraty was one of those romantic locations, south of Rio on the Costa Verde, a gem dating back to Brazil’s colonial times. Around five hundred kilometres north of Rio and deep within the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, is a most remarkable place. Ouro Preto was discovered at the end of the seventeenth century by Portuguese gold prospectors who discovered ‘black gold’ that changed colour due to its iron content. São Paulo is one of the mega cities of the twenty first century and with a population of twenty million it is the economic heart of Brazil. The railway helped to transport cotton and later coffee, and its large station, with British-designed clock tower, became an important  symbol. Brazil is synonymous with sunshine, samba and exotic nature, a dream destination full of both adventure and constant fun!

Travel Videos HD,  World Travel Guide 
Brazil is the largest country in South America and fifth largest in the world. Famous for its football (soccer) tradition and its annual Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Recife and Olinda. It is a country of great diversity, from the bustling urban mosaic of São Paulo to the infinite cultural energy of Pernambuco and Bahia, the wilderness of the Amazon rainforest and world-class landmarks such as the Iguaçu Falls, there is plenty to see and to do in Brazil.

See in Brazil
=========
Amazon Rainforest - The Amazon River Basin holds more than half of the world's remaining rainforest, and over 60% of that lies within the North of Brazil — approximately one billion acres with incredible biodiversity. The region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, over 40,000 plants species, 2200 fish species, and more than 2,000 types of birds and mammals. One in five of all the bird species in the world live in the rainforests of the Amazon, and one in five of the fish species live in Amazonian rivers and streams. 

Atlantic Forest (Mata Atlântica) - A region of tropical and subtropical forest which extends along the Atlantic coast of Brazil from Rio Grande do Norte state in the Northeast to Rio Grande do Sul state in the South. The Atlantic Forest has a wide variety of vegetation, including the many tree species such as the iconic araucaria tree in the south or the mangroves of the northeast, dozens of types of bromeliads and orchids, and unique critters such as capivara. The forest has also been designated a World Biosphere Reserve, with a large number of highly endangered species including the well-known marmosets, lion tamarins and woolly spider monkeys. Unfortunately, it has been extensively cleared since colonial times, mainly for the farming of sugar cane and for urban settlements — The remnants are estimated to be less than 10% of the original, and that is often broken into hilltop islands. However, large swaths of it are protected by hundreds of parks, including 131 federal parks, 443 state parks, and 14 municipal parks, most of which are open to visitation.

Campos Gerais - With a vast vegetation of grasses and areas of transition between the Cerrado and Atlantic Forest, this region offers beautiful scenery of cliffs and canyons, as Jaguaricatú Valley, beyond the fifth and the eighth most extensive canyons in the world, which are respectively Guartelá and Jaguariaíva . Jaguariaíva the canyon is made more beautiful rafting activity in Brazil.

Pantanal - A vast tropical wetland expanse, one of the world's largest. 80% of it lies within the state of Mato Grosso do Sul but it also extends into Mato Grosso (as well as into portions of Bolivia and Paraguay), sprawling over an area estimated at between 140,000 and 195,000 square kilometers (54,000-75,000 sq mi). 80% of the Pantanal floodplains are submerged during the rainy seasons, nurturing an astonishing biologically diverse collection of aquatic plants and helping support a dense array of animal species.

Waterfalls (Cachoeiras) - Brazil has an amazing range of impressive waterfalls of all sizes and shapes. Iguaçu Falls, in eastern Parana, is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world, truly a sight to see. The 353-meter Cachoeira da Fumaça in Bahia's Chapada Diamantina National Park is the country's second highest waterfall, after the Amazon's almost inaccessible Cachoeira do Araca. Other famous waterfalls include Caracol Falls, in a Rio Grande do Sul state park of the same name near Canela, Itaquira Falls, an easily accessible 168-meter fall near Formosa, Goiás, and the gorge at Parque da Cascata near Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais. Aside from the nationally famous falls, in many parts of the country, particularly the South, Southeast, and Central West regions, you are rarely far from at least one locally-famous, named waterfall worth a short hike.

Architecture
------------------
Colonial architecture - Many cities have reminders of Brazil's colonial past, with churches, monasteries, forts, barracks, and other structures still intact. Some of the most concentrated and best-preserved colonial buildings can be found in old gold-mining towns such as Ouro Preto and Tiradentes, but many other cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Petrópolis, Salvador, Recife, Paraty, and Goiânia have quite significant colonial centers as well.

Oscar Niemeyer works - Niemeyer, Brazil's most famous architect, is a modern architectural pioneer who explores the aesthetic impact of reinforced concrete, using curves to create buildings with a unique sense of space.",travel

93,Xk5-2u0kw0,Sao Paulo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"São Paulo, one of the world’s most populated cities, is Brazil’s exciting hub of business, culture, creativity and hospitality.

‘Sampa’ was founded in 1554, at the spot of the historic Pátio do Colégio. Once home to the region’s first main Catholic Church, the central Praça da Sé now houses the towering Metropolitan Cathedral. 

Two beautiful historic buildings have been transformed into Cultural Centers: The Banco do Brazil and the Júlio Prestes Train Station. While the city’s most esteemed museums are the São Paulo Museum of Art, on the famous Avenida Paulista, and the Pinacoteca do Estado. 

The Viaduto Santa Ifigenia, an art nouveau bridge, leads pedestrians to the ornate Municipal Theatre, with its impressive Sala São Paulo concert hall.

Don’t miss Ibirapuera Park, which is home to the modern Ibirapuera Auditorium, the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art and the Afro Brazil Museum.

Meet Brazil’s soccer heroes through the interactive exhibits of the Football Museum in Pacaembu Stadium. Nearby, Vila Madalena is a bohemian district with quirky stores, funky cafés and colorful street art.

In the Mercado Municipal, tourists gather to taste the local cuisine while the Paulistanos bargain for fresh produce and gourmet food.

Explore all of São Paulo’s neighborhoods and bustling cultural hubs to discover that this city is not only the engine behind Brazil’s economy, but also its cultural powerhouse.

Through many setbacks and roadblocks, I managed to meet a lot of great Brazilian people who helped me accomplish these goals over the course of a year living in Brazil.

It was most definitely one of the greatest experiences of my life.

RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL - Food in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro!   

Favela - An unregulated, informal neighborhood in Brazil. There are estimates of as many as 1,000 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many of the favelas in Rio de Janeiro are full cities within themselves, where nearly everything is available.

It’s without a doubt that a lot of crime and organized underground criminal activity happens and is controlled in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. However, favelas across Brazil are home to some of the most hard working, friendly, happy, and creative people in Brazil as well. So in this video my goal was to meet and to highlight some of the amazing people that call favelas home. 

Rocinha - The first favela we visited was Rocinha, the biggest favela in Rio, one of the biggest in Brazil. We met up with Guilherme who took us on a walking tour to some viewpoints and to some Brazilian food places.

Sabor da Roça - The most well known little snack shop on this street in Rocinha, we stopped for a coxinha, one of the top Brazilian food snacks. It was packed with chicken and with some hot sauce it was amazing. 
Price -  2.5 BRL ($0.63)

For lunch we stopped at an alleyway restaurant in Rocinha, where he cooked up a lunch set included beef ribs, cassava, pasta, rice, and beans. It was simple, but delicious and hearty.
Price - 10 BRL ($2.52)

Morro da Providência - Favela number two is one of the first favelas of Rio and located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, near the port and up on a hill on the side of the cliff. We met up with Jura, who is an absolute Brazilian food cooking legend and an amazing person.

One of Jura’s most famous dishes is nhoque de camarão, an Italian but Brazilian potato noodles in Jura’s own creation sauce of shrimp and coconut milk. It was simply outstanding, all made from scratch.

But the dish I was most interested in eating and which Jura expertly cooked, again from scratch was her feijoada - often considered the national dish of Brazil, and one of my personal favorite foods of Brazil as well - there are few dishes of the world more comforting than beans and pig parts with rice. When you’re in Brazil, you can eat feijoada at many restaurants, but home-cooked is by far the best.

Thank you Jura and Elena!!

This was one of the best days I had in Brazil in terms of learning, meeting people, and food, and it’s an experience and memories I’ll never forget. 

You hear a lot of the negative that comes out of favelas in Brazil, and it is true. However, the positive side and the amazing people, are not often recognized, and it was truly memorable to see and learn about this side of hope in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Facing the South Atlantic coast, the second-largest city in Brazil is blessed with one of the most beautiful natural settings for a metropolis in the world. The dazzling landscape is just one of the reasons that visitors flock to Rio. During carnival season, the streets fill with music and ornately costumed dancers, attracting revelers from all over the globe. At any time of year, visitors won’t want to miss the top tourist attractions in Rio de Janeiro.",travel
113,fnKcEZL9Wg,"Rio De Janeiro, Brazil: Cost of Living 4K","Even with all the non-stop travel, our Passport Heavy crew never found  ourselves in Rio De Janeiro Brazil…until now. And what an experience it was! A city bursting at the seams with culture, food, dope views, beautiful people, amazing beaches, plenty of activities and deep history, Rio De Janeiro sure is a city worth experiencing.

We were naturally on edge after hearing all the stories of how dangerous parts of Rio De Janeiro are, but similarly to Chicago or New York, the danger is a bit overhyped. There may be dangerous parts in the city, but believing the city is dangerous takes away from all the other amazing experiences in the city.

We had an incredible time in the city, and would like to thank the city of Rio De Janeiro for having us, and letting us experience Brazil. Enjoy this Passport Heavy Cost of Living guide to Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.

In this Brazil travel vlog, you will learn from the expert. I grew up coming here every year and will teach you the inside tips about downtown Buzios, including the nightlife.

More details about what you see in this Brazil travel vlog:

► Buzios: The official name of the city is 'Armação dos Búzios', but everyone just refers to it as 'Búzios'. This is a beach community in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and a popular getaway for Brazilians and Argentinians. Basically an unknown fishing village until the 1960s, it was made famous by French actress Brigitte Bardot. 

► Rua das Pedras: Translating, the name means stones' street, and that's exactly what you'll see. More than that, it's Buzios' main street, with an active nightlife and a nice variety of shopping and restaurants.

► Orla Bardot:  Named after Brigitte Bardot, this is the strip of land that connects Praia da Armação with Rua das Pedras, the main street in town. Brigitte Bardot is also honored along the oceanfront path with a bronze statue.

► Praia da Armação: This beach is located downtown, next to Rua das Pedras and in front of Orla Bardot. To this date, it is still full of fishing boats. Their old houses have been restored and are now lovely restaurants and pousadas. From this beach, you can get the boat tours to the various other beaches in Buzios.

► WHO AM I?

I am a Brazilian journalist living in the United States. After traveling the world working with sports, news, and events for over 15 years, I realized that what I really love is the travel part of it all. So I exchanged the life in the newsrooms and stadiums for the daily challenge of being an independent content producer. 

I created this channel to share the beauties of the world... stuff that for so long I only kept to myself. Also to help people planning similar trips and to inspire more people to venture out and enjoy life!

P.S.: The guy who occasionally appears in the vlogs is my husband, Gordon. He is Canadian-American and is extremely shy, that's why he's behind the camera most of the time ;)

This video covers the Don'ts of Visiting Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Copyright Mark Wolters 2017 
1. Don't expect to get anywhere quickly in Sao Paulo. With so many people, cars and craziness it will take you longer than what google says it will to get anywhere. 
2. Don't skip the Mercado Municipal! This Sao Paulo tradition is amazing. From amazing fruit to the best bologna or sorry Mortadella sandwich you ever ate. 
3. Don't skip out on eating non-Brazilian food while in Sao Paulo. There are tons of amazing places, foods, restaurants and styles for you to enjoy! 
4. Don't lose your wits. Pay attention! Sao Paulo has a reputation for crime for a reason. 
5. Don't expect a beach vacation. Sao Paulo is not a Brazilian beach city, it is a cultural, shopping, museum, business hub for South America.

Brazil’s Costa Verde is an incredible ribbon of coastline between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Here the emerald jungles of the Serra do Mar plunge into the Atlantic in spectacular fashion, but nowhere more so, than at Ilha Grande Bay. 
 
Just a two-hour bus ride from the non-stop-energy of Rio, Ilha Grande Bay offers rhythms that are in total tune with nature. Once here, you’ll find yourself caring less about finding the perfect Wi-Fi signal, and more about connections of a deeper kind.
 
One hundred miles to the southwest of Rio is the historic port town of Angra dos Reis. Once slave ships unloaded human cargoes bound for the vast coffee plantations of the interior. Today the port is a popular escape for Rio’s harried locals. 
 
Once you’ve explored the town, there are endless beaches to enjoy, while offshore, over 350 islands are calling. Climb aboard a ferryboat or set sail on a schooner to the bay’s undisputed jewel, Ilha Grande. For much of last century, this incredible island was home to Brazil’s Alcatraz. What was once purgatory for the country’s most notorious felons is now heaven for nature lovers.
 
For those seeking the best kinds of treasures, Ilha Grande’s riches know no bounds.",travel
124,HH4i18UiMFE,Visit Brazil - Bus Travel in Brazil,"When traveling around Brazil be ready for the Buses! Here are some helpful tips for Bus Travel in Brazil. 
1. you can buy some tickets online, but without an official Brazilian government number you may not be able to buy tickets online. 
2. There are a number of bus companies in Brazil and they serve different destinations. Make sure you look for bus companies that specifically focus on travel to where you want to go. 
3. There are different levels of bus service in Brazil. The more you pay, the better the service. 
4. Always have your ticket with you, they check it multiple times. 
5. Keep all important stuff with you on the bus. Big backpacks go under the buy, but have a small day pack with your tickets, passport, snacks and drinks with you.
6. Bring screwtop bottles of drinks as the rides can get bumpy.
7. The buses are relatively on time, but do not push it with tight connections if you are looking to get a flight as traffic can be crazy in Brazil.

Our visit Rio De Janeiro travel guide documentary, before the Olympics of 2016, covers some of the top attractions including a food guide (best restaurants and street food), top museums and Rio at night. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities you won't find in a typical Rio De Janeiro tourism brochure or Rio De Janeiro, Brasil city tour.

25 Things to do in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil Travel Guide and Top Attractions Transcript:

First up, we started with the city’s most iconic sight: Christ Redeemer. We boarded the train as soon as the station opened and made our way to the top of Corcovado Mountain. Sometimes the statue can be shielded by fog, but we lucked out with beautiful blue skies and panoramic views of the city as far as the eye could see. 

For a bit of colour, we headed over to the Selaron Steps, which is a tiled staircase created by Chilean artist, Jorge Selarón. Initially Selaron would scavenge construction sites looking for tiles, but in later years as his work gained notoriety, travellers began donating tiles.

Since we chose to stay in the neighbourhood of Ipanema, we ended up spending quite a bit of time at Ipanema Beach. We noticed that this beach was really popular for beach football, volleyball, and surfing. And of course, what makes this beach so iconic are its two mountains, known as Dois Irmãos. If you come here on a clear day, you can catch a killer sunset.

No visit to Rio de Janeiro would be complete without heading up Sugarloaf Mountain, so when the skies finally cleared that’s exactly what we did. We paid for our tickets and boarded the cable car for a somewhat unnerving ride up. If you’re scared of heights, this probably isn’t the attraction for you, however, if you manage to make it to the top you get some really cool panoramic views of Rio. 

Copacabana Beach is the most famed beach in all of Rio de Janeiro and if you were to visit on a weekend during the summer months you’d find that the place is packed beyond belief. We happened to be here in winter so things were a lot more relaxed, but that didn’t stop visitors from braving the waters. 

We did a  favela tour to Babilônia and Chapéu Mangueira. On our tour we saw lots of street art, learned about life inside a favela.

And that is a wrap! We hope this video will give you guys some ideas of things to do in Rio de Janeiro on your visit, and for those travellers who have already been there, feel free to add your suggestion of cool activities and attractions in the comments below.

This is part of our Travel in Brazil video series showcasing Brazilian food, Brazilian culture and Brazilian cuisine.

What's up BearMovement!
Welcome to my São Paulo Travel VLOG, it's been tough to leave Jericoacoara behind and coming into a vibrant city like São Paulo is a tough change. Loud noises, pollution and a ton of people are something completely different than the nature I experienced before in Jericoacoara.

There will be more videos from São Paulo, especially from the Brazilian Carnival. São Paulo should be on everybody's list if you're asking yourself - ""what to do in Brazil"". São Paulo has everything you want to offer, good food, culture, nightlife, street art and a ton more.

What to do in São Paulo in 3 days? Go explore, see where the journey takes you and enjoy the stay.

Hope you enjoyed today's São Paulo Travel VLOG - more content coming soon!

I spent 48 hours on the beautiful island of Floripa and made it my mission to experience as many of the 42 beaches as possible.

Thanks to the guidance and advice of local friends, I can definitely say, without reservation, that I found paradise. 

Best Beaches of Florianopolis: 

Campeche Beach - One of the widest and longest stretching beaches in Florianopolis.

Joaquina Beach - Famous for its big sand dunes and surfing breaks, Joaquina has long been the most popular beach in Floripa.

Mole Beach - In recent years, Mole beach is taking over Joaquina's thrown as the ultimate hot spot for the young, cool crowd. Come here to surf or hangout and stay for the beautiful women of Floripa!

Jureré / Jureré Internacional - This part of the island is dedicated to the rich and famous. Huge homes, beautiful beach and lots of money to go around. There is also a really cool fort close to Jureré Internacional that you should check out while you're in the area.

Santinho Beach - Off the beaten path and a little bit of a task getting there, Santinho is a great spot to escape the crowds. Although there's a big resort on one end of the beach, if you time it right you'll have more than enough space to enjoy the beauty of rolling green hills crashing down into the ocean.

Lagoinha do Leste - Absolute paradise. As you saw from the video, it takes a little while to get there, but that makes it all the better. Come during high season and you'll have to share the space with surfers... a small price to pay for perfection.

132,TOVlscESoag,Brazilian Food - 5 Foods You MUST EAT in Brazil,"Comida Brasileira, Brazilian Food! Brazil is full of delicious meats, fruits, and specialties. Here we go through six overall tasty treats you should have when you come to Brazil. The best of Brazilian food, so you know what to eat when you visit Brazil. 
1. The Lanches: the snacks like Pao de Quiejo (cheese bread), Coixinha do Frango (fried chicken dough ball), and such that go great with a Chop (draft beer) or a Caipirinha (the local Brazilian mixed drink), and if you don’t like alcohol the drink of brazil is Guarana. 
2. The Meats: Brazil is full of great meat and the most famous meats you will have at a Rodizio or Chrassasco. Here they walk around with many different types of meats from chicken hearts to ribs, but the most important is Picanha, a specific kind of Brazilian cut of meat. 
3. The Fruits: Brazil is full of amazing fruit and many you might not have heard of. Visit a market and try fruit you never saw before and have juices made fresh just for you. 
4. The Sweets: those fruits go well into many of the bolos (cakes) that are in Brazil, but if you want some chocolate have Brigadeiro, a chocolate made with sweetened condense milk. There are also traditional favorites like doce de leite (cream caramel) or doce de abobara (sweetness of pumpkin). 
5. The Local Dishes: each region in Brazil has its own specialities so make sure you are trying what is popular where you are. The south is famous for its beef. The northeast is great for seafood. Bahia has acaraje a bean paste taco kind of dish with shrimp inside. Sao Paulo has its own mortadella/bologna sandwich, or chicken cooked in its own blood in Minas Gerais. 
6. Beans and Rice: beans and rice will appear on the menu again and again and even if you didn’t order them expect beans and rice. They are a staple of the Brazilian food culture. Some typical dishes that highlight these are Caldo de Feijao which is a bean soup/stew dish you have as a starter. Feijoada which is the Brazilian bean stew you will have served with rice, kovi, fried banana and with a ice cold chop (beer).

#1. Brazil is More Than Just Rio de Janeiro - yes the beaches and Christ of Rio are well worth visiting, but Brazil has so much to offer from the Rainforest in the Amazon, to the Beaches of the Northeast to the Pantanal to the mega city of Sao Paulo there is so much to see, so explore more than just Rio.
2. Eat Regional Dishes: everywhere you go you will find regional amazing food in Brazil so explore the local cuisine as well as the more traditional Brazilian fair. 
3. Be Smart & Dress the Part - Brazil has security issues so be smart when traveling around the country. It is not as bad as the media makes it out to be but there are issues. So be smart when traveling around and dress the part, don't show bling or any wealth to help you avoid any problems. 
4. Pack Your Patience - Brazilian time is a bit different than other times around the world so make sure you have lots of patience when you need something done. 
5. Be Ready for the Brazilianisms: Brazil has their own way of life and own way of doing things so be ready for electric showers, crazy parades and fun and laughs.

160,Ql9Suw5Odtg,Belo Horizonte Through Local Eyes - Travel Deeper Brazil (Ep. 9),"Belo Horizonte, Brazil - http://www.tourist2townie.com/ 

Travel Deeper with me on a long weekend to the capital of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte. 

I met up with a local friend and he showed me his favorite things to do in Belo Horizonte. 

I explored the central market, visited the cultural center, took a day trip to Inhotim, discovered the vibrant Belo Horizonte nightlife and checked out the Feria Hippie on Sunday. 

In between all this, I had a chance to see a different side of the city and interact with locals, which left me with an incredible travel experience. 

I can honestly say that the people of Belo Horizonte were some of the most friendly and welcoming that I've met during my year of living in Brazil.

We also ate some great food from street venders. Salvador has the most beautiful beaches, markets and great shopping. Grandpa’s favorite place was Pelourinho but the kids favorite place was Big Jump!

197,iGU6dXuIcJE,"Unseen SUPERFOOD in Amazon Jungle - Real Way to Eat AÇAÍ (You’ll Be Surprised) in Belém, Brazil!","🎥Lemongrass Ants in Amazon Rainforest: https://youtu.be/6HngwHe3QCA
🍌Banana Chips available now!! 
👕T-shirts: 

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.

BELÉM, BRAZIL - The state of Pará in the northern part of Brazil, still located in the Amazon jungle, is one of the most gorgeous and food rich states of Brazil. Along with massive river fish, one of the main foods grown in and around Belem is açaí (acai), the small berries from the acai palm tree.   

Before going across the river to a harvest açaí (acai) and for a full Amazon jungle food meal, we stopped at the Belem market and bought a chunk of fihote, a type of Amazon catfish.

We met up with our friends, and took the boat to Cumbu island, to meet with relatives of Lana, who arranged for us to have an entire açaí (acai) food experiences.

When you think about açaí (acai), unless you’re from Belem, you probably think about a sweet fruit bowl covered with fruits, and possibly some granola mixed in. That’s all I knew about acai before coming to Belem. But in the state of Para, acai is eaten totally different. The berries are ground into a paste, and eaten as a main dish with a full meal - typically with fried fish.

One of the reasons why açaí (acai) is eaten this way only in the northern Amazon rainforest is because açaí (acai) really doesn’t travel or export fresh. It spoils so fast, within hours of being ground. So typically they sweeten it and make it into a sorbet to get around the world - which is why it’s then prepared into a sweet fruity açaí (acai) bowl. That’s not bad at all, just totally different from how they eat it in the Amazon.

Along with an outstanding acai feast, we also had maniçoba, another staple of Para food - cassava leaves cooked for 7 days to take out the poison and cooked with a variety of pig parts. It’s a wonderful dish.

It was an amazing learning experience, and I’ll never think of açaí (acai) the same again.

Travel Videos HD,  World Travel Guide 
Rio de Janeiro is the second largest city in Brazil, on the South Atlantic coast. Rio is famous for its breathtaking landscape, its laidback beach culture and its annual carnival.

The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is comprised of a unique entry from the ocean that makes it appear to be the mouth of a river. Additionally, the harbor is surrounded by spectacular geographic features including Sugar Loaf mountain at 395 meters (1,296 feet), Corcovado Peak at 704 meters (2,310 feet), and the hills of Tijuca at 1,021 meters (3,350 feet). These features work together to collectively make the harbor one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World . 

Beaches in Rio de janeiro, Brazil
================
Even the most seasoned tourist will find the beaches here quite amazing. They are wide and clean, with soft white sand. The main beaches from Leme to Barra have plenty of services for the beach goers, including free showers at the beach, wet trails to walk on cool sand, clean pay toilets, life-savers and police, tents and chairs for rent, soft drinks and alcoholic bars, food.

The beaches are from East to West (Downtown outwards):

Ramos (in-bay) - inappropriate for bathing
Flamengo (in-bay) - usually inappropriate for bathing
Botafogo (in-bay) - inappropriate for bathing
Urca (in-bay) - usually inappropriate for bathing
Vermelha (oceanic) - Mostly appropriate for bathing
Leme (oceanic)
Copacabana (oceanic)
Arpoador (oceanic)
Ipanema (oceanic)
Leblon (oceanic)
São Conrado (oceanic) - sometimes inappropriate for bathing
Barra da Tijuca (oceanic)
Recreio dos Bandeirantes (oceanic)
Grumari (oceanic)
Abricó (oceanic, nudist beach)

Abricó is the only official nudist beach in the area of Rio de Janeiro, it lies next to Grumari beach. Only accessible by car/taxi. An option is taking the bus numbered S-20 (Recreio) that passes along Copacabana/Ipanema/Leblon, and from the end of the line (ponto final) take a cab, for a travel time of almost 2 hours.

It is also worth visiting the beaches in the island Paquetá, particularly: 

Praia da Moreninha (on the Guanabara Bay, but often not clean enough for swimming)

Cariocas have a unique beach culture, with a code of customs which outlanders (even Brazilians from other cities) can misconstrue easily. Despite what many foreigners may believe, there are no topless beaches. Girls can wear tiny string bikinis (fio dental), but it doesn't mean they're exhibitionists. For most of them, it's highly offensive to stare. Until the 1990s, men and boys wore speedos, then wearing bermuda shorts or trunks became more common. Speedos (""sungas"" in Portuguese) and square leg suits are now making a comeback. Jammers are less common but still accepted.

Waves in Rio vary from tiny and calm in the Guanabara bay beaches (Paquetá, Ramos, Flamengo, Botafogo, Urca) to high, surf-ideal waves in Recreio. In Leme, Copacabana, Arpoador, Ipanema, and Leblon, there's a popular way of ""riding"" the waves called pegar jacaré (pe-GAHR zha-kah-REH; literally, ""to grab an alligator""). You wait for the wave to come behind you then swim on top of it until it crumbles next to the sand.

Commerce is common in Rio's beaches, with thousands of walking vendors selling everything from sun glasses or bikinis to fried shrimp to cooling beverages (try mate com limão, a local ice tea mixed with lemonade, or suco de laranja com cenoura, orange and carrot juice). For food, there is also empada (baked flour pastry filled with meat or cheese), sanduíche natural (cool sandwich with vegetables and mayo) and middle eastern food (Kibbehs and pastries). Vendors typically shout out loud what they're selling, but they won't usually bother you unless you call them. All along the beaches there are also permanent vendors who will sell you a beer and also rent you a beach chair and an umbrella for a few Reais.

The beaches in Barra and Recreio (Quebra-Mar, Pepê, Pontal, Prainha) were favored by surfers and hang-gliders until the 1980s, but now they are outnumbered by the middle-class and nouveau riche from the suburbs and also West Zone favela residents, such as now world-famous Cidade de Deus (City of God, made famous in the eponymous film).",travel

201,QhahEGLZ6O4,Jericoacoara & Paradise in Preá - Travel Deeper Brazil (Ep. 12),"A perfect day of adventure in Jericoacoara and Preá Beach in Northeastern Brazil - http://www.tourist2townie.com/

After a long, seven-hour bus journey from Fortaleza to Jericoacoara, I arrived at the Rancho do Peixe Pousada (hotel) on Preá Beach where I fell in love with the private beach bungalow right on the beach. 

The next morning I took my first Kitesurfing lesson right on property and was completely hooked after a few short hours.

Thanks to the favorable weather and wind conditions, Jericoacoara and Prea Beach is surrounded by some of the most popular coastline for Kitesurfing in Brazil. 

From kitesurfing lessons at Rancho do Peixe, I hitched a ride in a buggy, across the beach and through the sand dunes of Jericoacoara National Park to the town of Jericoacoara. 

I strolled around the quiet village for the afternoon before making my way up the giant sand dune at the edge of town to watch the sun set behind the Atlantic Ocean. 

It was a beautiful day and well worth the trip from Fortaleza to Jericoacoara. 

If you ever travel to Brazil and visit Northeastern Brazil, I highly recommend coming up and meeting Jeri and staying at Rancho do Peixe!

206,Kqlez4PDi,Amazon Rainforest Adventures - Travel Deeper Brazil (Ep. 15),"Come with me down the Amazon River into the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest for a wild week of adventure. - http://www.tourist2townie.com/

A BIG THANK YOU to Amazon Gero Tours and the entire staff for hosting me, and keeping me alive. 

For the best Amazon Tour from Manaus, check them out - 

- AMAZON ADVENTURE - 

There are certain places on this planet that seem almost like fiction. 

Unreachable destinations that you expect to only see in story books and documentaries. 

The Amazon Rainforest in northern Brazil was one of those places for me. 

So when I had the opportunity to come to Brazil, I wasn't going to miss the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream. 

My experience began in the gateway city of Manaus, where the journey into the jungle proved to be a task unto itself...

I took a taxi from the airport down to the city's main harbor. 

It was here that had my first glimpse of the incredible size and scope of the Amazon river on ground level. 

From here I crossed the river on a small shuttle boat, passing the point where the Rio Negro converges with the Amazon which forms a really cool color divide in the water.

Once on the other side, I passed street vendors selling giant fish and wild fruits, before boarding an old VW wagon. 

Past the small towns and giant lilly pads, we drove further away from civilization before making one last transfer into a small motorboat.

As we weaved through the flooded forest, the reality of this experience started to set in! 

The Ararinha Jungle Hotel would serve as the launch pad for all my Rainforest adventures. 

By day we explored the river and trekked through the Amazon rainforest.

In the water we looked out for exotic birds, hidden lizards and even the rare pink dolphins and on land it was giant spiders, poison dart frogs and all types of monkeys. 

While the rare Anaconda and Jaguar were always in the back of my mind, it was the smaller animals that you really had to be aware of.     

We would go catch piranha in the shallow waters and then boat out to the middle of the river nearby to swim.

It was a dangerous and beautiful place, and my senses were heightened the entire time. 

Throughout the process, Kenrick and the other guides taught me some important skills and techniques for surviving in the jungle. From making weapons and building shelter to finding the best things to eat if you're hungry.

Another side of life in the Amazon, is the close-nit community of people who live along the river. I was expecting to see naked tribes and face-painted cannibals, but that wasn't the case at all. 

I had the opportunity to meet and interact with many local residents and despite the remote location, life here seems relatively normal, and it comes with an alluring simplicity and self-sufficiency. 

One morning we visited one of local farms who were in the middle of cultivating the popular Brazilian staple, Farinha or Farofa. He should us how to transform the poisones root into an edible side-dish and I even popped my top to help out.

On another day we were invited to a house party with some of the off-duty guides and surrounding neighbors. 

It was great to see what life was like on a Friday night with people my age in the Amazon.

And at night, when the sensible locals would turn in, we'd launch the boat again and head out to explore the darkness. 

With 75% of the animals here being nocturnal, the noises and commotion at night were like nothing I've ever heard.

The easiest thing to spot were caimans, whose beady red eyes surfaced across the river. And apparently, if you're fast and quiet enough, you can reach down into the water and grab one.

On my final day in the Amazon, we decided to take a small crew out to get the full effect of the jungle, and go camp out.

We found a flat, dry space not far from the river and worked quickly to setup camp before dark. 

We chopped trees for a tarp frame, cautiously gathered firewood and began cooking dinner over the fire. 

As darkness and a little paranoia set in, we enjoyed dinner and drinks to the developing sounds around us. 

We listened to music, played cards, and of course, peed close by. 

We had some more drinks, made hats out of palm branch and shared stories well into the night.

After an camp-made breakfast with fresh fruit, eggs and coffee, it was time for me to pack up and head back to Manaus. 

And although I spent a week engulfed in this incredible place… the people, the wildlife, the environment… everything still makes the Amazon seem like fiction...

211,2_0U8K03_MY,Recife Living & Porto de Galinhas - Travel Deeper Brazil (Ep. 14),"Recife, Brazil - http://www.tourist2townie.com/

It's a quiet morning on the beach in the Boa Viagem neighborhood of Recife. 

And while you're likely to run into a few fisherman and beachgoers, you won't find many people actually in the water here, 

As it's said, this is the most dangerous beach in the world do to the heavy shark population just offshore. 

And as much as I'd love to jump in and prove it, I decided to skip the swim and head downtown to see what life's like on land in the Capital city of Pernambuco. 

The historical center is lined with colorful buildings and cheerful people.

Frevo music is in the air and signs of carnaval are everywhere. 

Recife and neighboring Olinda, host one of the best carnival celebrations in the country and no matter when you go, you'll witness the setup or remains of the year's big event. 

One of the main attractions during Carnaval here are the Bonecos Gigantes or Giant Puppets, and I just so happened to followed a guy into the Giant Puppet embassy to see the incredible collection of wood and paper mache figurines on display. 

The puppets are usually famous celebrities, athletes and public figures and are carried like floats during the local parades. 

They're a little bit creepy but entertaining to say the least. 

That afternoon I had the opportunity to do something really special.

A local friend invited me to an after-school program that she's involved with in Recife's largest Favela of Brasilia Teimosa. 

The group is called Driblando Crack and it uses sports like soccer to help kids in the community avoid drugs and trafficking. 

We spent the afternoon hanging out, talking about life in Recife and of course, playing a little futebol. 

After an awesome time with the crew, I made my way over to catch a sunset boat tour through downtown Recife. 

Our large pontoon boat cruised through the wide canals and rivers as I took in all my surroundings. 

And while I wouldn't consider it to be the ""venice of South America"" as some have labeled it, it was great to see the city from many different perspectives on day one.  

The next morning I was up early to go on a little adventure. I borrowed my friend's car and set out on a day trip to Porto de Galinhas. 

The first thing you notice upon arrival in the small beach town, is that the people of Porto do Galinhas or Port of Chickens really love their name. 

Besides the tacky bird figures everywhere, the beach itself is long and beautiful, and a natural reef just offshore makes for great snorkeling and scuba diving.

I spent the afternoon just relaxing in the sand before making the hour and a half ride back to the city.  

Luckily for me, I made it just in time to meet up with friends for some traditional Brazilian nightlife… Karokee!",travel

When I asked Brazilian friends on places I should visit while traveling in southwestern Brazil, the overwhelming response was always Bonito. 

The small town of just over 17,000 people is tucked away in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul and is one of the most popular Brazilian tourist destinations in the region. 

Famous for its abundance of natural beauty, including wildlife, waterfalls and crystal-clear rivers, Bonito, is one of the best outdoor adventure spots I've ever visited. 

On day one I rented a bike from town and road through the countryside to two different eco parks, Porto da Ilha and Balneário do sol. Freshwater pools connecting to small waterfalls and numerous activities makes these spots the perfect relaxing day trip.

That evening I ventured over to the Brazilian Rodeo at the Clubes de Laço (lasso club) just outside Bonito to experience a different aspect of Brazilian culture. 

The next morning I drove over to Recanto Ecologico Rio da Prata (The Silver River Ecological Reserve) to snorkel the beautiful transparent water teaming with aquatic life.

From there we went to Buraco das Araras (Sinkhole of the Macaws) to witness hundreds of Macaws and other exotic birds fly around the giant redrock hole in the ground. 

That night I experienced the quiet and lovely downtown Bonito and drank some locally brewed cachaca at the popular Taboa. 

Needless to say, it was a great weekend in Bonito, Brazil and I can't wait to come back again soon.

Lufthansa Food Review: Bangkok - Frankfurt - Rio de Janeiro

Biggest trip of the year - Bangkok to Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It took 40 hours to complete the journey, and we took Lufthansa Airlines.

In this video I'll show you my full trip, review especially the food on Lufthansa in economy class. We took our first flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt, Germany, and then had something like a 16 hour layover in Frankfurt.

Our second flight was from Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro. The journey was very long, but all went well and very happy to be in Brazil!

217,8ANDPk02Ezk,Curitiba Parks and Private Parties - Travel Deeper Brazil (Ep. 13),"Curitiba, Brazil - http://www.tourist2townie.com

Thanks to some exceptional urban planning in the 50s and 60s, Curitiba has become internationally recognized as a model “Green” city. 

Home to over two million residents with more than 150 square miles of public parks and forests, Curitiba has been voted one of the best places to live in all of Latin America.

I spent the first day visiting the Botanical Gardens, Japan Square, Passeio Público, Tanguá Park and the local Curitiba favorite, Barigui Park. 

After a full day of exploring the local park scene, I was invited by some local friends to a special culinary event called ""Mesa ao Vivo."" 

A group of four famous Brazilian chefs created dishes on live TV that day and then presented them to a small group of friends and peers that evening.. and somehow, I was lucky enough to be on the list. 

We started off with Rosé bubbly paired with a spin on some local favorites like Coxinha, sausage and steak tartar. 

Then it was white wine with Scallops, farofa and a dash of doce de leite. 

The main course was red wine and Costela (or ribs) with Pinhao, a local nut and fermented pineapple. 

For desert we had a light and fluffy coconut creme with apples and honey over a drizzle of chocolate moose. 

It was an incredible evening that opened my eyes to the culinary movement happening in Southern Brazil at the moment and I was so thankful to be a part of it. 

The next morning I was up early to go explore more of downtown Curitiba and take in all the sites and sounds of the city. 

After cruising around the city, I met back up with local friends for a more traditional approach to Brazilian cooking.

We talked about life in Curitiba over delicious meat and cold beer as my perception of Brazil broadened once again. 

Curitiba clean, safe and incredibly refreshing. The people were warm and accommodating and I can definitely see why it's looked at as such a great place to live.

Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil - From Curitiba we continued our food trip in Brazil to Goiânia in the state of Goiás, Brazil. It was a day of unique fruits, most specifically the pequi fruit, unlike any other natural unprocessed food I’ve ever tried in my life.   

Mercado Central de Goiânia - We began at the central market, where we walked around first, before trying a number of empadão, one of the main snacks to eat - a little dough pie filled with a variety of ingredients. It was delicious and hearty, especially when topped with some of the house made hot sauce. Price - 32 BRL ($7.93) for all

Exotic fruit - There was a jungle exotic Brazilian fruit shop where we sampled a few fruits like jatoba, before continued on this Brazilian food tour.

CIDADE DE GOIÁS - The main goal of the day was to drive to the historical city of Goiás, about 2 hours from Goiânia. The drive was beautiful and it was nice to see some of the countryside.

Restaurante Braseiro - But by far the highlight of the day was eating at Restaurante Braseiro, an extremely friendly and traditional Brazilian food restaurant. When we arrived I could already sense the love coming from the restaurant, and I loved the way they cooked the food, all over fire in the kitchen buffet style. The day we arrived they hadn’t cooked pequi fruit, but when we arrived and said was had come specifically to eat it, they cooked it for us. Pequi is a very unique and slightly bizarre fruit from this region of Brazil. It can be dangerous because of the spikes in the center - so don’t bite too deep. But the flavor is unlike any other fruit I’ve ever had, almost like cheddar cheese. Price - 20 BRL ($4.95) per person

Banca da Pamonha - When we got back to the city, we continued with a few Brazilian street food snacks, including pamonha, which is the local version of a tamale. I was impressed how good they were. Price - 26 BRL ($6.44) for 3

Boteco do Zé do Abílio - Finally to end this Brazilian food tour, we went to Boteco do Zé do Abílio to have some serious meat. Total price - 118 BRL ($29.23)

It was an amazing day in Brazil, and especially a regional Brazilian food learning experience.

231,EpRCBdLuYY,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Part 1 (Travel documentary in Urdu Hindi)","Rio de Janeiro or simply Rio, is the second-most populous municipality in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. The metropolis is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Brazil and sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state. 

Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília.

Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and 30th largest in the world in 2008, estimated at about R$343 billion (IBGE, 2008) (nearly US$201 billion). It is headquarters to Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific output according to 2005 data.

Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches[9] such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of Christ the Redeemer atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the Sambódromo (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums.

Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city. The Maracanã Stadium held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games. Its considered the second most beautiful city in Brazil, after the city of Curitiba.",travel

From a wide expanse of nearly 3 kilometres, the water plunges down into the depths below and creates a thunderous roar amid the tropical scenery. 

The Rio Iguazu has its source in the Serra Do Mar and on its 1,300 kilometre journey, it is fed by 30 tributaries. Up to 80 metres above sea level, around 270 waterfalls form prior to reuniting in a pool below.

The subtropical climate, surrounding rain forest and lush vegetation provides the perfect habitat for many kinds of plant and animal life. Sunlight shines out in the spray of the water masses and creates an array of wonderful rainbows, a constant natural spectacle.
 
Roaring curtains of water, thunderous noise, glittering spray is all created by the mighty, natural wonder that is the Iguazu Waterfalls!

Hey everybody!
Today we're going to be counting down
the best things to do in Iguazu Falls Brazil...

My number one pick for the best thing
to do in Iguazu Falls is the Macuco Jet Boat safari
it's amazing
it takes you right into the centre of the falls you get under the water and what a thrill
One of the things I highly recommend you do is head out
to the Itaipu Dam
It is the second largest dam in the world
and let me tell you 
you really feel the force of the water
while you're there
While you're out there
do a sunset tour of the Itaipu Lake it's a great way to go out and watch the sunset and have a little cocktail while you're at it 
When you come to Iguazu make sure you take the catamaran tour that sunset is beautiful
And don't forget to visit Parque das Aves the famous bird park
lot's of great birds there to see, some of them  you can't even see in the wild
Half of the birds here are rescues and half are actually bred here
An Amazing place to come if you're in Iguazu
Come to Marco das Americas to see where Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil all meet
 And if you're looking for a place to stay
I highly recommend the Belmond das Cataratas it's the only hotel that's right inside Iguazu National Park
And it gives you access to see those waterfalls and sunrise and sunset  where you have them all to yourself
And when you're inside the park you've got to go down to the catwalk and walk right out into the falls it's really cool to be surrounded by waterfalls
Make sure you go and visit a bit of the downtown there are a lot of things to see 
there's different museums
One thing that stood out to us is visiting the traditional mosque
And you go to a Chinese temple and walk around the peaceful gardens 
If you want to see the falls from a birds eye point of view
A helicopter tour is always recommended
This wasn't the best helicopter tour 
we've ever taken but it was a great way to see the falls for a very short time up in the air
If you want to get into the heart of the jungle
go to the Bananeiras Trail  this is really cool
you can do a ten kilometre bike ride into the jungle
then a hike then some kayaking and even a speedboat tour
It's a full day of adventure
So those are our favourite things to do in Iguazu Falls in Brazil if you like what you saw today make sure you subscribe to our channel",travel

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.

MANAUS, BRAZIL - From Belo Horizonte, we flew to Manaus, a city in the State of Amazonas, which is in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. It’s the biggest city in the Amazon, and it’s surrounded by massive rivers and jungles. I was so excited to be there. We landed in the mid-afternoon, so we just had a few hours to walk around and explore, and get our first impressions of the Amazon.   

Mercure Manaus Hotel - Thank you to Mercure Manaus Hotel for hosting all of us during our stay in Manaus, and for the amazing dinner.

We first drove to the market where we sampled a few local fruits. Most of the fruit stalls were closed, but a few were open and mainly we tried Cupuaçu and a type of wild passion fruit.

Amazon Theatre - One of the most important landmarks and sights of Manaus is the Amazon Theater, a beautiful theater in the middle of the city.

Restaurante Canto da Peixada - I wanted to try a local freshwater fish dinner before going back to the hotel, so we stopped to eat a grilled tambaqui, one of the prized fish of Manaus, Brazil. It was delicious. Total price - 89.70 BRL ($22.96)

Dinner at Amazon Restaurant at Mercure Hotel Manaus - Finally we were invited for dinner back at the hotel where they prepared us an amazing Amazon meal including a huge mix of dishes. I didn’t even know I was digging into the piranha soup, and it was so good. Freshwater turtle is also a major part of the Amazonian food diet.

It was a great few hours and my first impressions of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.

258,kY5G8s99Fl8,Iguazu Falls Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Iguazu.d612633...

Iguazu Falls is located at the junction of three nations: Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. These “Great Waters,” as named by the indigenous Guarani people, are made up of 275 waterfalls that span nearly 2 miles. Sorry, Niagara!

Any Iguazu Falls tour will provide you with a sense of nature’s power and wonder. You can follow a boardwalk trail and take in the majestic, roaring falls from a safe vantage point…or, if you feel daring, a platform above the falls. Look down, but hang on to the railing—that’s a lot of water pouring beneath you.

Don’t mind getting wet? Take a speedboat safari beneath the falls and enjoy the spray. Prefer to stay dry? A helicopter ride over the falls might be for you. From up high, the falls form a tremendous chasm in the surface of the earth, further solidifying the fact that this area is one of nature’s great wonders.

Surrounding the Falls are the two Iguazu National Parks, one located in Brazil, the other in Argentina. The parks are home to beautiful rainforest full of exotic creatures, like wild cats, reptiles, and 400 species of birds and butterflies. There’s far too much here to see in a day, so plan an extended visit to Iguazu. You can even stay the night in the national park and see more of it in the morning.

How did you feel when you saw Iguazu Falls?

259,FgqMfVnT614,"BRAZIL TRAVEL, HOLIDAY IN BRAZIL","BRAZIL TRAVEL, HOLIDAY IN BRAZIL,  Jericoacoara is a resort town in the eastern Brazilian state of Ceará. It’s known for wide Jericoacoara Beach. Restaurants and bars line its sandy streets. Principal Square is at its heart, on Rua Principal, the lively main road. The town is ringed by freshwater lagoons such as Paradise and Blue lagoons, and by Jericoacoara National Park, with vast sand dunes. Sunset Dune is a popular sundown viewpoint.  Jericoacoara is a small fishing village cum beach hippie mecca in Ceará, Brazil, some 300 km west of Fortaleza. Jeri, as it is affectionately known, is the kind of idyllic place where many travelers end up deciding to stay for longer than they had originally planned.  Jericoacoara is a place removed from the hurried modern world of screeching sirens, maniac deadlines, traffic jams and endless lineups. A place where streets are paved with sand, where beaches stretch as far as the eye can see and where warm water marries with palm swaying breezes. Until about 20 years ago, Jericoacoara was still a secluded and simple fishing village. There were no roads, no electricity, no phones, no TV's, no newspapers, and money was rarely used.

Since 1984, the area around Jericoacoara was declared Environmental Protection Area (APA) and became a National Park in 2002. This brought many building restrictions and tourism controls what help to preserve the area. Electricity arrived in the village and today, hot showers and air conditioning are no longer luxury articles. However, illumination of the streets is forbidden by local law.  Jeri is full of things to do for the active and extreme as well as for those who wish to relax and recharge.

Pedra Furada The Arched Rock has become the symbol of Jericoacoara. It offers beautiful vistas from all directions. If you happen to be in Jeri between June 15th and July 30th, you will have the good fortune to witness the sunset right in the middle of the Arch; it's an excellent photo opportunity. Walking east from town along the shore line you'll first pass Malhada Beach, which is a smaller beach popular with surfers. On low tide most of the beach is walkable, otherwise take the higher path up along the Serrote hill. The walk takes about 2 hours in total. You should not do this barefooted; bring footwear for the rocky patches (and occasional snakes!). Depart immediately after sunset, as the night falls quickly. Guided hikes can be arranged at many of the hostels, and this is highly recommendable if you are walking along the beach. Local guides know high and low tides better. If you take the path along the grassy dunes, you may do it on your own. You will probably find other tourist on the way.
Windsurfing Jericoacoara is one of the best spots in the world for windsurfing and is certainly the best spot in Brazil, for both experienced windsurfers and beginners. Various windsurf centers can be found along the main beach.
Helio Windsurf, ☎ +55 88 99462199 (info@cumelen.com.br), [1]. An excellent place to rent equipment or take a lesson is Club Ventos, which provides the most recent neilpryde, jp and starboard equipment.  edit
Gaia Windsurf, (End of Rua de Forro, right on the beach), ☎ +55 (88) 36692150 (alvarozabala@hotmail.com), [2]. Alvaro runs this small windsurf rental/school and can tailor packages for whatever you need. Thing don't alway move too fast, but service is good. It's a lot cheaper and more flexible than the bigger Club Ventos, but the equipment is also a bit more worn. Also arranges trips, transfers to/from Forteleza and anything else.  edit

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.   

MANAUS, BRAZIL - During my food trip to Brazil there was no place I wanted to visit more than the Amazon Rainforest. We flew to Manaus (if you look at a map, Manaus is directly in the heart center of the Amazon). The jungle, the unique dishes and fruits, and the people made it incredible.

Exotic fruit tasting - One of the things that you have to do when you’re in Brazil, especially in the Amazon is sample all the unique and indigenous fruits of the region, some that are only available there. We started with mari-mari, an amazing long pod fruit and have inga (ice cream bean fruit) and biribá - wild sugar apple. All the fruit - 10 BRL ($2.55)

Manaus is a pretty big city, especially for being in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. They have a big market, full of fruits, vegetables and fish. We headed straight for some tucumã, a type of palm tree fruit that’s essential in the local diet.

Jenipapo - Along the way we also tried some jenipapo, a pretty unique fruit.

Tucumã sandwiches - Sandwich shop owners better take note! Tucumã sandwiches are a true Amazonian food and they are delicious. Along with the palm fruit they were paired with cheese and fried sweet banana. It’s a perfect breakfast and way to start the day in the Amazon. Price - about 10 BRL ($2.55) per sandwich

Tambaqui fish - Tambaqui is a fish from the Amazon that’s known for having ribs - seriously almost like pork ribs. We decided to get a fish to bring to the village since we weren’t sure what they’d have al the village.

Amazon village - We didn’t really have a plan, we were just going to find a boat driver and ask him to take us to a village and see if anyone could cool. So we got a boat, and our boat driver asked if they were home and if we could invite ourselves in. We arrived completely unplanned and unannounced and it turned out to be an outstanding learning experience and fun time with an amazing family in the Amazon.

Along with the food we brought, the family mixed up about 4 different exotic drinks - some of them known in the Western world as ingredients in trendy energy drinks - but here in the Amazon of Brazil they are consumed regularly.

It was such an awesome Brazilian Amazonian food meal with the family followed by a time of drumming and dancing, football, and finally a swim in the river. It was an extraordinary day in the Amazon of Brazil.

City Description:
Fortaleza is the capital of the northeastern Brazilian state of Ceará. It's known for its beaches, which are punctuated by red cliffs, palm trees, dunes and lagoons. Fortaleza’s long-standing folkloric traditions are presented in dance performances at the art nouveau José de Alencar theater, open since 1910. Another architectural highlight is the neo-Gothic Catedral Metropolitana.The popular beach neighborhood of Praia de Iracema hosts lively nightclubs, restaurants and the EMCETUR Tourism Center, a former 19th-century jail with craft shops in the cells, downstairs from the Museu de Arte e Cultura Popular. The Meireles neighborhood is known for its beach boulevard and nightly handicrafts market. The Dragão do Mar art and culture center features movie theaters and museums in a contemporary setting that contrasts with the 19th-century colonial buildings it neighbors. Inland, visitors can hike amid mangrove swamps at the sprawling Cocó Ecological Park on the Rio Cocó river.

Weather and Events:
Peak periods include summer (Dec–Feb), which is hot and dry, and Jun–Aug. Carnaval (Feb, dates vary) and the pre-Carnaval street parties in the weekends leading up to it is a busy period. Other key events are the São João/Festa Junina celebrations (Jun), featuring folk dancing; Fortal (Jul), an off-season Carnaval with concerts; and Ceará Music (Oct/Nov), an international rock and pop festival. The climate is tropical and warm year-round, with a rainy season Apr–Jul.

271,KZDf-hQo0hM,Food & Travel Brazil - Bakeries in Rio de Janeiro,"Pick up a snack or have fresh juice at the local bakery in Ipanema.

If you want to grab a quick bite or a drink, just buy from a bakeries that are a good bet in Rio. Small bakeries and cafes like this one are present all over Rio de Janeiro. Pattiokas are the locals here. Frequent them for fresh bread. And it is a quick and convienent snack place for tourists. Some of them even have seats for a sitdown meal. At this padaria they offer a variety of juices. But at some juice key offs in Rio, you can find over 100 different flavors. 

The favorites in the city include: Marakacha, it is a passion fruit. Abacashi Qualaca ka, which is pineapple with mint. Or if you are feeling a little adventurous you can try avocado juice. It is really, really good. ""What is your name?"" ""Juraci. The padaria is 84 years old, and I have worked here for eight and a half years."" ""Is there any type of bread that is sold more often?"" ""French bread."" Okay, so let's show you what this place has. We have the fresh bread that is made several times a day. And we also have some sweet bread here. Because sweet season is kicking in. There are several varieties of cookies. 

And now we are going to show you the saga genios, or the snacks that they have in Rio. ""Yes, I am here on vacation visiting my mother here in Ipanema."" ""And what did you buy today?"" ""I bought bread and mortadela. Actually, my mom lives right here on the corner. So this is really close, and the padaria is really great."" Pavadinia is a popular snack from Brazil. I am going to show you some of the most popular. So you have an easy time selecting them, when you are in the country. 

We are going to start with the pastel. It is a fried pastry dough usually with cheese or meat in it. We have the bonticasial, which means cheese bread. It is definitely great with different tastes of coffee. We have the keybew, which is from Arab origin. And it has meat and wheat in it. And this is a Kosheenya, my personal favorite. Which has chicken and usually a cheese. In Rio, before you get the food you have to pay for it and get the receipt. Then you go back to the counter and pick up your food. I have my receipt now. I am going to go to the counter and pick up my Bontekashu. I am Marisa Collins, and I am showing you Rio de Janeiro.",travel

Number five, Salvador da Bahia. Brazil is a country of immense diversity of cultural and natural landscape. Salvador da Bahia is known for its eclectic culture and lifestyle. 

Number four, Brasilia. You may be surprised to learn that Brasilia is the capital of Brazil. Take time to experience the beautiful architecture of the city that is the seat of government. 

Number three, Curitiba, a thriving metropolis in southern Brazil. Amidst the urban landscape you'll find gems like the botanical gardens and magnificent artistic theater venues. 

Number two, São Paulo, an economic powerhouse of Brazil. One of the largest cities in the world, the city is full of landmarks that draw visitors from all over the world. 

And number one, Rio de Janeiro, considered to be among the world's most exciting cities. Spectacular natural settings, festive beach scene and its carnivals make this a great city.

276,0tEImejdi_,"Amazing Street Food, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) - Travel Guide","When it comes to street food, Rio de Janeiro has plenty to offer.

Here in Rio De Janiero it is impossible to escape the delicious sights and smells of the street foods available here. We are here at a tapioca store in Impanema. Tapioca is one of the more popular street foods you will come across here in Rio. They are kind of like a crepe with a multitude of fillings. There is meat, there is sweet and cheese and that is basically your tapioca pancake. Well though not Brazilian in origin, many vendors also sell churros. It is a sweet dessert not unlike a donut, fried, battered. But the secret is in the hollow middle they will fill with chocolate sauce or dulce de leche, which is caramel. 

Popcorn is one of the most popular street foods in Rio. You can get either the sweet, dulce, or the salty, sargado, or possibly the best thing, a mistuda (Unclear), getting both mixed together. In the sargado, you might find a few nasty suprises in the form of bacon chunks, so just look out. Another snack you are likely to see everywhere is called corn on the cob. Keep an eye out for the shiny steel carts and get it served right in the husk of the corn slathered in butter. 

On the beaches you are likely to find many people with homemade barbecues and the delicious (Unclear) which is grilled cheese. So there is a selection of the street foods available here in Rio De Janiero. For the most part delicious, safe and very cheap. But just two words of warning, if the guy selling you the imparted does not look quite right best avoid it. There are some terrible horror stories about what it can do to you. This has been Doug Gray showing you Rio De Janiero.",travel

Featured accommodation and kite center in Prea: 

Our full spot guide for kiteboarders here: 


Lagoons drone footage by Morne Maritz. Filmed by Luke McGillewie.
On Brazil’s endless coast, there are more kite beaches than one could count. But we went in search of a beach with that perfect combination of ripping wind, a vibrant community, and breathtaking sunsets. We couldn't quite settle on a favorite, so in this edition we're covering the kiteboarding beaches of Prea and Jericoacoara 

Last time, we covered the Brazil downwinder experience with Surfin Sem Fim. After exploring 200km of Brazil’s northeast coast on a big downwind adventure, we needed to park our kite bags in one spot for a while! So we settled into a beachfront bungalow at Rancho do Peixe where we could have some kite sessions right out front on the ocean or take a short buggy ride to that famous Brazil flatwater.

A kiteboarding trip to Brazil is one that will be etched in your memory forever. You may find yourself planning your next trip back as soon as possible!

On day two, I took a dune buggy tour with some other travelers to the famous sand dunes just outside the city of Natal. 

It was an incredible experience filled with offroading, ziplining, slip-n-sliding and lots of swimming. 

Natal is my favorite of all the Northeastern cities I have visited in Brazil. The beaches are incredible and I will definitely be back again soon.

288,JbzBtmXXqU,Is Brazil Safe to Travel To?,"I get asked by nearly 100% of my guests, is Brazil safe to travel to? Both the international and local media portray this country in a very negative light. It is as if, the second you step off the plane, something terrible will happen to you. So either the dream of visiting Brazil, stays a dream, or you arrive with paranoia. Neither are good!

As a resident of Rio de Janeiro, I want to share with you a few basic guidelines that I follow in Brazil. 

I have been here many years and understand that there is no exact formula for what, where or when to avoid. And while I know people that have had personal items stolen from them in the street, I have never experienced this personally. I do not avoid places I want to go to or live in a way out of fear. Life goes on as normal here.

I want to reassure you that we live normal lives, we have normal  daily routines. You just need to remember a few details to keep you 'street smart' and then let go and enjoy your beautiful trip.

289,7ERYmONJVq,My travels in Brazil with Audley Travel,"Audley specialist Jeff captured this footage on his research trip to Brazil.

The vivacious dancers and floats of Rio de Janeiro’s Carnival seem to embody Brazil’s verve and swagger. At the other extreme, there are the unspoiled waterworlds of the Amazon basin and the Pantanal, where all kinds of wildlife flourish in quiet, barely inhabited pockets. Our specialists have a great affection for this cavernous, contradictory country. They’re enthusiastic about showing you its many incarnations on a Brazil tour, perhaps taking you from the undeveloped beaches of the Northeast Coast to the bookish colonial town of Paraty in the south.

We can point you toward experiences that only a trip to Brazil can offer: you might not expect to find an opera house on the edge of the rainforest, but it exists in Manaus. And, where else can you see capoeiristas refining their dexterous dance-come-martial-art on beaches at sunset — or catch spontaneous bursts of samba drumming in the middle of a busy street?

The bustling city of Rio de Janeiro has been one of Brazil’s most popular and frequented tourist destinations for decades. Its vibrant city centre is bursting with culture and pulsating with a deep sense of history and heritage. Rio, as it is commonly known, is the second largest city in Brazil and the third largest metropolis in the whole of South America.

It is the most visited city in the Southern Hemisphere, which is no mean feat. This makes for an impressive, memorable attraction for visitors from all over the world.

Rio de Janeiro is hot for most of the year, and rain is frequent during the period between December and March. The coastal areas are cooler than those situated inland due to the cool breeze blowing off the blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The average annual temperature is between 21 and 27 degrees Celsius. The landscape and vegetation in and around this metropolis are magnificent, providing a visual feast that has inspired authors and screenwriters the world over.

Because of its many cultural and historical attractions, Rio has implemented fabulous infrastructure to cater to the needs of its visitors. This includes world-class accommodation and plenty of tours. Rio de Janeiro was one of the Host Cities™ for the 2014 FIFA World Cup™, welcoming millions of people as they make their way to this international sporting event. In addition, it did host the 2016 Summer Olympics™, inviting sportsmen and –women, as well as their millions of fans, to focus their attention on this bustling destination. Major efforts have been made to minimise social inequality and modernise the economy of Rio de Janeiro to further improve its global standing. This makes for a very special destination.

During your time in Rio, you are urged to see the following fabulous attractions:

• The incredible surfing waves off Prainha. Whether you conquer them yourself or just watch the water-bound athletes skimming effortlessly over and under them, these waves are impressive.
• Tijuca’s lush, dense rainforests, which boast a number of hiking trails for those wanting to experience the fauna and flora first hand.
• Laze on the shores of Ipanema Beach or one of the many other beaches for which this city is renowned.
• Marvel at the sheer scale of the statue of Christ the Redeemer as it overlooks the city far below.
• Take the cable car up Sugarloaf Mountain for spectacular views.

• Stroll down the famous Avenue Nossa Senhora de Copacabana.
• Take an official walking tour of Rio, learning fascinating facts about its historical and modern-day heritage.
• Wander amongst the more than 5 000 species of plants and trees at the Jardim Botânico (Botanical Garden). The palm species alone exceed 900.
• Sports enthusiasts simply must experience the Maracanã stadium, which seats 100 000 spectators and has been the venue of many a heart-stopping match between international football greats.

292,YgoVp5tbByY,Recife Brazil Temple Trip,"Recife is a beautiful city in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. This is the first trip I have taken in Brazil without my husband and kids. 
Temples in English – 
Templo em Portugues-   
Mormon Church -  
Igreja Mórmon -  
There are 6 total temples in Brazil and 4 in the process of being built. The Recife temple is huge and was built to serve the people in Northern Brazil. Every single week large groups of LDS members arrive here to serve, perform ordinances and be taught by God. We traveled in a large, comfortable commercial bus. My stake plans one of these trips about every 3 months. We crossed four states and spent 17 hours on the road. It was totally worth it!! 
I left my husband and kids at home to go on a weeklong temple trip. During the week I attended multiple sessions, performed baptisms and sealings. Both in Portuguese and in English. I also had a lot of fun with friends from church. I laughed, relaxed and ate great food. Video 51

10 Top Tourist Attractions in Brazil
Ouro Preto
==========
One of Brazil’s best-preserved colonial towns, Ouro Preto, meaning “black gold”, was founded at the end of the 17th century. It quickly became the epicenter of a new gold rush in the state of Minas Gerais. The city contains well preserved Portuguese colonial architecture, while modern buildings must adhere to historical standards maintained by the city. 18th- and 19th-century churches decorated with gold and the sculptured works of Aleijadinho make Ouro Preto one of the most popular tourist attractions in Brazil.

Teatro Amazonas
==================
Teatro Amazonas or Amazon Theatre is an opera house located in Manaus, in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. It was built during the heyday of rubber trade using materials from all over the world, with furniture from Paris, marble from Italy, and steel from England. On the outside of the building, the dome was covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the Brazilian national flag.

The first performance was given on January 7, 1897, with the Italian opera La Gioconda. The opera house was closed down soon after however as the rubber trade declined and Manaus lost its main source of income. There wasn’t a single performance in Teatro Amazonas for 90 years until 1990 when it reopened its doors.

Fernando de Noronha
==================
Fernando de Noronha is a beautiful archipelago with pristine beaches, landscapes and wildlife, situated 354 km (220 miles) off the northeastern coast in Brazil. The archipelago was discovered by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503 and temporarily occupied by the Dutch and French before Portugal established dominion in 1737. Today only the largest of the 21 islands is inhabited with a population of about 3,500. The islands are a Mecca for divers and snorkelers with warm waters year-round and very good visibility even at depths of 50 meters.

Historic Center of Olinda
======================
Another well preserved colonial city, Olinda is located on the Brazil’s northeastern coast, just north of Recife. Olinda features a number of major touristic attractions, such as a historic downtown area, churches, and the famous Carnival of Olinda. Many bars, restaurants, artist and craftspeople studios add charm to the old-town setting.

Salvador Beaches
=================
Salvador is the capital of the state of Bahia, with an attractive colonial town, a vibrant musical scene and loads of exceptional beaches all around. The beaches range from calm inlets, ideal for swimming, diving and sailing, as well as open sea inlets with strong waves, popular with surfers. There are also beaches surrounded by reefs, forming natural pools of stone, ideal for children.

Pantanal
=============
The Pantanal is the world’s largest wetland, lying mostly in Western Brazil but extending into Bolivia and Paraguay as well. Famous for its wildlife, it is one of Brazil’s major tourist attractions. Unlike the Amazon rainforest, in the Pantanal you are virtually guaranteed to actually see the wildlife. Capybara and the Yacare Caiman are present in the millions. The Pantanal is also home to one of the largest Jaguar populations in the Americas.

Rio Carnival
===========
There are carnival celebrations in virtually every corner of Brazil, the best-known ones taking place in Recife together with the neighboring Olinda and Salvador. But the biggest and most famous carnival is undoubtedly the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. 
Amazon River
===========
At approximately 6,400 km (4,000 miles) the Amazon River is the second longest river in the world, just slightly shorter than the Nile, and the largest river by volume. The Amazon has over 3,000 recognized species of fish and new species are still being discovered. The Amazon Basin is covered by half of the planet’s remaining rainforests. Although a tenth of the world’s estimated 10 million living species live in the Amazon rainforest, jungle tours are more about the boating upriver into the damp, buzzing, oppressive ambience than actually spotting animals.

Iguaçu Falls
============
One of the great natural wonders of the world, Iguaçu Falls is situated on the border between Brazil and Argentina. The waterfall system consists of 275 falls along the Iguazu River. The most impressive of them all is the Devil’s Throat a U-shaped with a height of 82 meter (269 ft). The falls can be reached from the cities Foz do Iguaçu in Brazil and Puerto Iguazú in Argentina, as well as from Ciudad del Este in Paraguay. On the Brazilian side there is a long walkway along the canyon with an extension to the lower base of the Devil’s Throat.

I've had a love affair with Rio de Janeiro for as long as I can remember. Or as Brazilians would say 'desde que eu me entendo por gente' :P 

Most Capeverdeans grow up watching Brazilian novelas where our fascination with the country and the marvelous city begins. I had high expectations of Rio de Janeiro but even then the city managed to blow me away and each time I visit I fall more in love. The friendly people, good climate, delicious food, many cool activities and the beautiful landscapes make this destination incredible and has something to offer to every traveller. 

I haven't met anyone who travels to Rio and doesn't instantly fall in love. There's a magic about this place that needs to be experienced and once you get a taste of it you're hooked! Next time I go I would love to visit Salvador, Fernando Noronho, Floreonopolis, Alto Paraiso and the Amazon. 

Brazil is a beautiful country and holds a magic that everybody feels when visiting. Can you tell how much I love this place?? :D

We share what you can reasonably expect from a 1-2 week trip there, including how much you will spend per day and how to stay safe in a country that has become more dangerous over the past decade. We also discuss if Brazilian girls are worthy for long-term relationships and marriage. Lastly, we analyze the direction Brazilian culture is headed, and if we expect a future decline in the women that puts them on par with American girls.

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.

BELO HORIZONTE, BRAZIL - Belo Horizonte is a city in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. It’s a beautiful city, very modern and metropolitan, and it’s one of the most well known states in Brazil for food. In this video, we just had a day off and walked around, ate lunch, went to a coffee shop, and visited some attractions in the city like Praça da Liberdade. (NOTE: Watch my full Belo Horizonte food tour here: )   

Prato feito - plate of the day - Here’s a term to know in Portuguese when you visit Brazil, which means the plate of the day. Plenty of simple restaurants will serve a plate of the day option that’s all you need on one plate. Today was the pork ribs, with collard greens, rice and cassava. Price - 13 BRL ($3.24) per plate

Rental car - about $65 per day - Throughout our Trip to Brazil, we rented cars in every city we visited, usually with Hertz (Localiza). Price came to about $65 per day.

OOP Café - We continued on to OOP Café, one of the best cafes in Belo Horizonte serving gourmet freshly roasted Brazilian coffee. Great place to have fantastic coffee when you’re in Belo Horizonte. Price - 7 BRL ($1.74) per cup

Praça da Liberdade - Finally in this visiting tour of attractions and daily living life in Brazil, we walked around Praça da Liberdade, a center square in the city, a park, and I especially loved the imperial palm trees. Big bottle water - 6 BRL ($1.49)

More details about what you see in this Brazil travel vlog:

► Cabo Frio: Cabo Frio is a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. With no traffic, you can drive in two and a half hours (way more on holidays and weekends). It's famous for its white sand beaches with crystal clear and cold waters

► Praia do Forte (Forte Beach): This is Cabo Frio's most famous beach.
Overlooking the sea, on the far left, is 17th-century St Matthew fort with its rusted cannons. Entrance is free.
More about Praia do Forte in this other vlog: 

► Ilha do Japonês (Japanese island): Beautiful uninhabited island at the beginning of the canal which serves the region's Araruama lagoon. There's no infrastructure in the island, but more often than not there are vendors selling food and drinks. There's a kiosk in front of the island on the Peró side, and it's easy to walk across the sea during the low tide.

► Passagem: This is Cabo Frio's oldest area, now fully revitalized. The neighborhood features colonial houses, many of them are now bars and restaurants. From Passagem you can get the taxi-boat to Ilha do Japonês for 15 Brazilian Reais

► WHO AM I?

I am a Brazilian journalist living in the United States. After traveling the world working with sports, news, and events for over 15 years, I realized that what I really love is the travel part of it all. So I exchanged the life in the newsrooms and stadiums for the daily challenge of being an independent content producer. 

I created this channel to share the beauties of the world... stuff that for so long I only kept to myself. Also to help people planning similar trips and to inspire more people to venture out and enjoy life!

P.S .: The guy who occasionally appears in the vlogs is my husband, Gordon. He is Canadian-American and is extremely shy, that's why he's behind the camera most of the time ;)

Hello everyone, thanks for coming by. Welcome to travelzilla! Today I show you one of my favourite regions in South America, the village of CARAÍVA in the southern shores of the State of BAHIA in the northeast of Brazil. CARAÍVA belongs to the county or minicipality PORTO SEGURO. It is a paradisiac place, filled with incredible beaches, abundant nature, a mix of cultures, incredible afro-brazilian, euro-brazilian and amerindian food, not to mention other cuisines. Caraiva is located 70 km south of downtown Porto Seguro. It is one of Brazil's oldest villages, founded by the Portuguese in 1530! Today it is located within a conservation area, very close to several native-american tribes. CARAÍVA is pretty interesting because here you can still see what the first villages the Portuguese founded in Brazil in conjunction to the local natives looked like! Of course Caraíva's got a modern twist to it. A lot of chefs live here, you can eat incredible food, enjoy paradisiac beaches with waters that keep changing colors throughout the day. Here the roads have remained purposely unpaved. there's no public electricity so that you can appreciate the moon and the stars at night. People here live a simple yet full live, very close to nature, so yes, paradise is here! 
I also give a lot of travel tips and information on how to get to CARAÍVA, the beaches you should visit while in the area such as PRAIA DO ESPELHO, CORUMBAU, , PRAIA DOS AMORES, PRAIA DO OUTEIRO, BARRA VELHA, PRAIA DA BARRA, SATU and other beaches, show you around the village and tell you all about prices so on and so forth! Let's no forget you can´t miss eating the famous sting ray pastries sold here as well as the place exquisite food! Caraíva is a hipster village in many ways, but it is also a backpackers paradise! This area of Brazil is perfect for backpackers. You can explore several destinations within Porto Seguro including ARRAIAL D'AJUDA, TRANCOSO, PORTO SEGURO CITY,  CARAÍVA and other counties nearby!

Costelão do Gaúcho - One of the things that Curitiba is known for, and all of southern Brazil, is meat - and especially the beef ribs are among the prized cut. Costelão do Gaúcho is an amazing restaurant that specializes in beef ribs. The owner is a master, treating each rack of ribs with respect and roasting and smoking them with precision. I loved his table saw method of cutting the ribs. The ribs were outstanding, as was the entire meal with all the side salads and dishes.

4 Beans Coffee Co. - We stopped in for a quick coffee, but that turned into a coffee roasting session, which was fantastic.

Lanchonete da Lombada - Here we go, the mega 5 kg. Lombada sandwich. Lombada means speedbump in Portuguese, because it was formerly a street food stall right in front of the speedbump. It was just insane, huge bun, layers of meat, hot dogs, massive quantities of squeeze cheese. It’s not a food challenge, but a very popular local family meal in Curitiba, Brazil. Total price - 50 BRL ($12.45)

Tio Dog (Uncle Dog) - Probably one of the most iconic of all the Brazilian fast food in Curitiba is TIo Dog, specialising in a number of different sandwiches and hot dogs. We got The Philadelphia, a bun filled with hot dogs, a variety of unknown sauces, and little crunchy chip fries. It’s one of those late night impulse foods - not something I’d eat on a daily basis.

Curitiba was fun, and it was a Brazilian food tour of meat!

4) Visit Saint Christopher's Church. After all, he is the Saint for travellers

On a hilltop in Ouro Preto, Brazil, is the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi.

This small, but elaborate church is one of the town's most beautiful fixtures.

Construction of the church began in 1766, by architect Antonio Francisco Lisboa in the Rococo style of architecture.

This man was a sculptor as well as an architect and designed both the structures facade and interior decor.

The double towers of the Church of Saint Francis and its roof makes it a unique and stunning sight.

361,-VV_Ijro1Z0,"Santa Catarina, Brazil - Unravel Travel TV","A land of a thousand faces. Human faces, and faces of nature. Located in southern Brazil between the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina is not easily defined. This small Brazilian state, with a little more than 6 million residents, unites within its unique 95 thousand km2 a diversity of scenery and people that marvels visitors. From white sand beaches, tropical forests and snowy mountains to Azorean fishermen, Italian farmers, and German industrialists, this is a land of beautiful, sharp and fascinating contrasts.

These contrasts are also found in the economy. A strong agriculture, based on small farms, shares space with an active industrial park, the fourth largest in Brazil. Large companies and thousands of small businesses are spread across the state, linked to consumer centers and ports by an efficient highway grid. These roads also boost tourism, a natural vocation of this small state, now the nation's third largest tourist center.

The balance and dynamism of the Santa Catarina economy are reflected in high levels of growth, literacy, employment and per capita income that are much above the national average. These numbers surprise and complement the fascinating profile of one of the most productive and beautiful Brazilian states.

By day we sunbathed and wore our best touristy pants by exploring famous landmarks such as the Selarón steps, Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf mountain. By dusk, we adventured up into the colorful favela's and danced to samba while overlooking the most gorgeous views of the city.

Welcome to Ipanema's Hippie Fair. This event takes place every Sunday, and it is a great place to pick up a variety of items. Now this fair has decades of history and hundreds of stands. You can find anything here: jewelry, clothing, leather goods, or a comfy new seat. But do not worry about fitting this on the plane, they take all the filling out, give it to you, and then you can refill it when you get home. 

Also, the center of the plaza turns into a temporary art gallery. You can pick out your favorite picture and get it wrapped to go. This is a great skirt for dancing forro, which is a dance that came from the northeast, but it is popular in all of Brazil now. For the little ones back home, you can pick up some really cute shirts or some baby booties. Look at this. They have got a map in stone. Brazilian artisan jewelry is one of my favorite things to pick up here, at the Hippie Fair. For example, these earrings, if you are feeling particularly patriotic, pick up a pair yourself. These are wax necklaces. They are actually a little thread enclosed in wax. It is really interesting. It has a little different texture to it, and definitely a good option. 

If you are looking for some nicer jewelry, they also have a great variety of silver products and you can pick out the rocks yourself. Now, on every corner of the Hippie Fair there's a stand of Bahian food. They have Acaraje, which is a traditional dumpling with shrimp, and they also have a variety of desserts. What he is playing right now is called the Berimbau. Expert, expert. I will leave it up to the professionals in this case. This is where we are.

376,JzlQn16rLH,HOW TO GET A VISA FOR BRAZIL,"This video explains how Canadian citizens can get a visa to Brazil.

Hello and Welcome to the Brazil Visa Information Video!
This video is an instructional tool for Canadian citizens and permanent residents who wish to travel to Brazil for business or tourism. 
Canadian citizens and citizens of most other countries must obtain an entry visa before they can travel to Brazil. The visa is a sticker that is pasted into your passport. If you do not obtain this visa before your travel, you will be denied entry at the Brazilian border.
This video contains information on
- The basic requirements for a Brazil visa
- The types of visas available
- The processing timeline and fees
- -How to submit Brazil visa applications
What are the basic requirements for a Brazil visa?

Firstly, the most important document you need for a visa is a passport. Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after your intended exit from Brazil. The passport must also have at least 2 blank pages for the visa to be pasted in. 

Secondly, visa applicants must complete and sign a form which provides their personal details as well as information on their trip. This form can be downloaded from the website of a Brazilian consulate or embassy in Canada.
 
Thirdly, applicants must have 1 passport-style photograph taken. This photo must be on a white background, with the full face in view. You should go to a professional photographer for the photo; do not attempt to take it yourself.

Fourthly, you must submit payment for your visa in the form of a money order. The embassy does not accept cash. 

Finally, you must submit a travel itinerary detailing when you will enter and when you will exit Brazil. This can be a flight ticket, cruise itinerary or any other official travel booking.

Travelers from certain countries will also need to provide proof of a vaccination against yellow fever. Brazilian authorities also recommend that if you are traveling to certain parts of Brazil that you get vaccinated. You can consult an embassy or consulate website for up-to-date information on vaccinations.

What are the different types of visas available to Brazil?
The two most common types of visas to Brazil are for tourism and business. Tourist visas are used by people who only wish to visit Brazil for tourism purposes, such as sightseeing or if you are with a tour group. Business visas are for those attending conferences, meetings or conducting other business while in Brazil. An important note: If you are applying for a business visa, you must provide a business letter from the sponsoring company indicating the nature of your trip with your visa application.

Visas are generally issued on a multiple entry basis, typically valid for 5 years. However, the length of validity is left to the consulate's discretion. 
An important note: you must enter into Brazil within 90 days of being issued the visa; otherwise, you will need to repeat the process and receive a new visa. 

What are the processing timelines and fees associated with a Brazil visa?
Processing timelines vary according to the consulate or embassy you are applying to. Visas are issued on a regular basis in 11-15 business days. In some cases, the visa can be issued on a expedited basis; this however is up to the particular consulate or embassy to decide. Visa fees depend on the type of visa you are applying for. The current price for a tourist visa to Brazil is $117 CDN. The current price for a business visa to Brazil is $108 CDN. These prices are only applicable for Canadian passport holders; others should contact a Brazilian embassy or consulate for pricing information.

How do I submit an application for a Brazil visa?
You have three options to submit a visa application:

1) You can go in person to a Brazilian embassy or consulate with all your required documents. At this time Brazil has consular representation in Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. 
2) You can have your application delivered to a Brazilian embassy or consulate using a courier company. In this case, you must provide a pre-paid courier envelope with your application so the embassy or consulate can return your passport. If you submit your application by mail, there is an additional fee of $18.
3) You can use a third-party to submit it for you, such as a travel agent or a visa company. In this case, the third-party will take care of the submission for you. If you submit your application using a third-party, there is an additional fee of $18.

We hope this video has been informative and will you help you obtain a visa to Brazil. We wish you the best of luck.",travel

Sponsors (( http://www.gct.com &  ))
Travel Videos HD,  World Travel Guide 
Salvador da Bahia has an energy and unadorned beauty that few cities can match. Once the magnificent capital of Portugal’s great New World colony, Salvador is the country’s Afro-Brazilian jewel. Its brilliantly hued center is a living museum of 17th- and 18th-century architecture and gold-laden churches. More importantly, Salvador is the nexus of an incredible arts movement. Wild festivals happen frequently, with drum corps pounding out powerful rhythms against the backdrop of colonial buildings almost daily. At night, capoeira circles form on plazas and open spaces, while the scent of acarajé (bean and shrimp fritters) and other African delights fills the evening air. Elsewhere in town, a different spirit flows through the crowd as religious followers celebrate and reconnect with African gods at mystical Candomblé ceremonies. In fact, there’s no other place in the world where descendants of African slaves have preserved their heritage as well as in Salvador – from music and religion to food, dance and martial-arts traditions.

Aside from the many attractions within Salvador, gorgeous coastline lies right outside the city – a suitable introduction to the tropical splendor of Bahia.

Chosen as one of Brazil’s 12 host cities for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Salvador is bracing for a major influx of visitors. Preparations have been slow to start, though. At the time of writing, construction was underway for an overhaul of the old Fonte Nova Stadium and city officials were discussing plans for improving the congested public-transportation system.


Salvador is the capital of the state of Bahia, Brazil. With a charming Old Town (a World Heritage Site), a vibrant musical scene and popular Carnival celebrations, it is considered one of the birthplaces of Brazilian culture. 

Do in Salvador Da Bahia - Brazil
===================
You'll find a huge variety of things to do in Salvador. Some of the popular activities include:

Day tour of Salvador
Salvador Parks
Salvador golf courses
Salvador music festivals
Surf trips

A good brazil tour guide in Salvador, known as a guia de Salvador, will be able to show you around lots of the attractions and activities if you want to explore on your own. A good option to get a general idea and find your way around in the city is the ""Salvador Bus"", an open-top tour bus passing by the main points of interest and offering explanation on the way.

Architecture
--------------------
At the center of the Cidade Alta there are the 2 large squares Praça da Sé and the Terreiro de Jesus which are connected at the corner by the cathedral. The latter is probably the most lively part of town, with food carts and stalls through the day and revelers in the evening hours. The slick, L-shaped Praça da Sé has cool fountains and the fenced-off ruins of the foundations of its namesake church. At the far end of the plaza, the 1874 funicular railway Plano Inclinado Gonçalves used to send 30-passenger cars between Cidade Alta and Cidade Baixa on terrifyingly steep tracks – it's been out of service since 2011, though plans to restore the train are in the works. A colourful intersection of vendors, tourists, capoeiristas and colourful locals, the Terreiro de Jesus is a historic site of religious celebrations, and is ringed by four churches, as well as the XIX century Faculdade de Medicina Building . The plaza feeds into the Cruzeiro de São Francisco , named for the cross in the square’s center.

Praça Municipal (City Square), Praça Tomé de Souza. Once the political seat of colonial Brazil, it is now a lively place to people-watch and see panoramic views over the bay. Overlooking the plaza, note the impressive Palácio Rio Branco, reconstructed in 1919; the original 1549 structure housed the offices of Tomé de Souza, Brazil’s first governor general.  

Largo do Pelourinho — A fairly small triangular plaza, is among the oldest parts of town. You can guess from its name meaning ""plaza of the pillory"" what went on around there.

Mercado Modelo — The city's main market located in the lower town is and a good place for crafts and other souvenirs. In the adjacent square you can often see young men performing capoeira, the famous martial arts dance which originates from the area.

Solar do Unhão — The best place in Salvador to watch the sunset. It is an old style house located at the Baía de Todos os Santos. Inside there is a small museum (Museu de Arte Moderna) with local art pieces. Sometimes on Saturday evening there is a jazz concert.",travel
383,JZfWxgLkP3A,Salvador Street Food & Capoeira Lessons - Travel Deeper Brazil (Ep. 1),"Salvador, Brazil is rich in history and delicious street food, so I set out to soak it all in! I took Capoeira lessons, danced to live Forró music and sampled local cuisine and cocktails with a local Brazilian friend. 

Salvador de Bahia is such a beautiful and interesting place, it's the heart of Afro-Brazilian culture in Brazil and new smells and sounds are only a narrow, cobblestone street corner away.
