We love abstract art as it is the perfect choice to decorate your home especially if you prefer a modern or minimalistic home design. Abstract art is a way to express your feeling without any special skills as you do not need to follow and guidelines. You can choose any color or form as there is no limitations just pure freedom. Moreover, you can use different unexpected tools to express your creativity. One of the easiest and popular kinds of art if fluid art. It takes only a few steps to create a masterpiece. Besides, it’s a really cool way to paint as you even don’t need brushes instead you can use a hairdryer, a mop and a piece of cardboard. So, you don’t need to have special art skills, take a canvas and acrylic paints and start creating a masterpiece. The main idea of fluid art is the process of pouring paints onto a canvas and spreading paint without a brush. The first step is to take a plastic cup and pour layers of different paint colors in it. Place canvas on top of your cup and carefully flip the whole thing over. Use a hair dryer to spread the paint over the canvas. Now you have a cool decoration item!
If you love impressionism, you can try to paint a picture using…a mop! Yes, it sounds crazy, but watch our tutorial and you will be surprised by the method.

Art is very beneficial for child development. Painting helps to relax, get rid of stress, concentrate, and last but not the least, it helps to develop fine motor skills and creativity. Today, we collected the best and the most fascinating art ideas for kids. I think you should try them all and tell us what you liked most.

The first painting is for those who love Japanese art. It's an incredibly beautiful painting – looks adorable and it may look good in any room (all you have to do is to try and play with different colors).

Crayons are amazing for painting! I bet, we'll show you some amazing hacks that you didn't know before. Amazing landscapes are waiting for you to repeat them! Choose what you like more – an evening forest or a lonely lighthouse in purple sunset waters. You can even learn how to draw a UFO abduction. 

You can draw amazing pictures using ink and water.

The following activity is really exciting! Have you ever heard of thread painting? This type of art and craft is really exciting – you never know the result. Try to do this with little kids and you'll see how excited they can be.

Watch this video up to the end and see how to paint animals out of words.

40,WsSqxqwIkwM,30 FUNNY FINGER ARTS AND CRAZY DOODLES,"It turns out that you can have fun without getting up from the couch and without gadgets! Did you know that you can draw on your own fingers so that it brings joy and fun? See how to do it. You can make a whole finger theater with your child - come up with banned characters and an interesting plot: about love, about crime, about the Apocalypse. 

How to teach a child to draw animals? Especially if you yourself are far from an artist? I will show you how to draw animals simply and fun. Drawing with the palms is a great educational activity for children, from which they will be delighted. See how to draw a bird, how to draw a giraffe, how to draw an ostrich, how to draw a peacock, how to draw a turtle, how to draw a snake, how to draw an elephant, how to draw a snail. 

You will draw adult animals, and the kid, due to the size of his palm - their children. You should have a whole zoo. For example, to draw a giraffe, we press the middle finger, the rest we take to the sides and draw around. It remains to decorate and get a giraffe with horns and ears.

A MAKEUP artist with bones as fragile as glass is on a mission to challenge the representation of disabled women in the fashion industry. Cary Velazquez, 29, from Ponce, was diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta three days before she was born. The disease, often referred to as ‘brittle bones disease’, is a genetic disorder that affects the strength of the bones. Cary began professionally doing makeup three years ago, after feeling inspired by beauty videos on YouTube.

Candace Worth founded Worth Art Advisory in 2001 to bridge the gap between contemporary art collectors and the increasingly exclusive art world establishment. Candace began her career in the Contemporary Art Department at Christie's auction house in the early 1990s. Since then, she has worked for a blue-chip gallery in New York City as well as an internet-based art consultancy. She now buys artwork for a highly diverse group of clients at all price levels, sourcing most of the work from across the United States and Europe. Candace currently serves on the board of the Drawing Center in New York City and has lectured on issues related to the contemporary art market at several art institutions, including the Rhode Island School of Design. Candace received her BA in Art History from the University of Pennsylvania and continued her studies in Art History at the Graduate School of Arts at Columbia University. worthartadvisory.com

94,7U67IDe46KU,STILL - The Thing About...Art & Artists - Donna Huanca,"Donna Huanca is a multi-disciplinary American artist who works nomadically, and has chosen Berlin as her base. Creating artwork with media including performance, installation and sound, she explores cultural hybridity by deconstructing them and recreating her own ceremonies. Materials like discarded clothing and second-hand fabric play a major role in her work. She interplays found objects from material culture which range from diverse
fabrics to metals that span from simple nuts and bolts to jewelry and silverware. Her work also includes organic elements such as dirt, smoke, and foods.  Clothing is a critical element in her work, because it represents the diversity and hybridity of culture today. The bright colors of the fabrics are evocative of ethnic clothing, sometimes referencing the tribal clothing of South America or rural Asia. Her portrait paintings are made of layered
scraps of clothing, fabric, fur or felt. While working, she uses cloth like paint by placing it on the canvas, whether that be a human body, a mannequin, or the wall. She controls the movement of the medium, but also lets it fall freely when necessary. 
As well as using models as elements in her works, she also places a level of importance on collaborative pieces, especially as installations and performance works.

108,V9RrO0dtu5M,How ancient art influenced modern art - Felipe Galindo,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-ancient...

The term modern art sounds like it means art that is popular now, but the style actually originated over 150 years ago and includes artists like Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin. What’s more ironic is that this movement they pioneered – considered revolutionary at the time – was inspired largely by objects of traditional and ancient design. Felipe Galindo details ancient influences on modern art.

110,UPk56BR1Cmk,Why art is important | Katerina Gregos | TEDxGhent,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Katerina Gregos is convinced that contemporary art has an important role to play in society, as one of the last frontiers of free expression. Today, artists and cultural practitioners, rather than politicians, are leading some of the key discussions about the state of the world. Contemporary artists challenge each and every one of us to reinterpret social and political events, and crack cemented opinions as well as dominant narratives propagated by the media and those in power. As an internationally respected curator, Katerina has curated a number of exhibitions dedicated to exploring the relationship between art, politics, democracy, the new global production circuits, and human rights. Let yourself be inspired by Katerina’s talk at TEDxGhent 2014, and find out what contemporary art can contribute to society.

Independent curator and exhibitions organiser

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Arts and Music

120,kD7fQJFBuOM,My Art // Accepted RISD & PARSONS Portfolio,"This video was meant to be filmed months ago.. but y'all know me..

I wanted to get this up because there aren't too many videos around where people showcase their full college accepted art portfolios- notably for RISD and Parsons School of Design. When I was an applicant, I found videos like this very helpful (at least for my anxiety at the time) so I do hope that prospective RISD and Parsons applicants find this informative!

I applied to a total of 3 colleges in my senior year of high school, (Rhode Island School of Design, Otis School of Art and Design, and Parsons School of Design). All of the pieces featured in the video were sent in my college application, though some pieces are not shown and were only included in my Otis application. But my ENTIRE portfolio for RISD is up on here! Nothing left out. 

I didn't talk too much into the actual application process, and I didn't give as much advice as I wanted to. This video is more about showing my portfolio, and if needed, I can put another one up specifically talking about the HOW of applying to art schools. Any questions, just feel free to ask below.

A few people have asked me why skillshare over youtube and my answer is this: I'm not saying to only use one or the other. I just think skillshare is a great site to have all your lessons neatly wrapped into one place. I've learned sooo much more about Adobe Premiere from skillshare and I actually did learn how to make that pumpkin spice latte!!! I still use Youtube all the time for things, it's just the overall neatness of Skillshare that I appreciate. I just feel like I'm learning more all at once when I use skillshare. You'll see what I mean if you try it out. I often mix what I learn on skillshare with what I learn on YouTube. Both are great!

133,qyKXw24JX5g,8 Artists: Advice to the Young,"Watch, listen and soak in the words of 8 prominent artists, who have strong and diverse thoughts on what constitutes insightful advice to young artists.  

Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovich feels that it is essential to be ready to fail. South African artist William Kentridge believes that good advice has more to do with the interaction between the person giving it and the person receiving it. Rock singer and poet Patti Smith shares the advice that writer William S. Burroughs once gave her: to build and protect your name by producing good work, and eventually the name will become its own currency. American singer David Byrne emphasizes the importance of not undervaluing your own artistic satisfaction. German film director Wim Wenders stresses that you have to do what no one else can do better than you. Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson recommends that you are sensitive to your surroundings - and British artists Dinos and Jake Chapman cut to the bone.  

For full-length interviews with the above artists and more, have a look here:

141,ATZFjJA2iz,23 Amazing Street Art Magic,"From Indoor Swimming Pool to Hawaiian Waves here are 23 Amazing Street Art Magic

Subscribe to Talltanic 

10. Layered Illusion
 These colorful, layered illusions are popping up all over the place, but very little is known about their artist: someone who goes by the name of 1010. His signature style is to layer colors on top of one another in order to create an illusion of depth. His illusions are turning urban landscapes into incredible colorful caverns, but where they lead is just as mysterious as the artist himself.
 

9. Melting Paris
 From a distance, it looks like the plaster--even the windows and metalwork--is melting in the sun, right into the street below. The new facade brought surrealism to life and is the work of Pierre Delavie. Amazingly, this is all the work of illusion photography. An image of the building was distorted using Photoshop and then set over the building’s actual facade. This illusion stayed in place for an entire year in 2007.

8. Indoor Swimming Pool
 This installation was put in place by famous artist Leandro Erlich. There’s no need to worry, the people in the swimming pool aren’t in danger of drowning--in fact, they’re in an empty room, viewing the people above them. The illusion is created by suspending water between two transparent sheets of glass, only about 10cm thick. This way, it feels like you might dive right into the pool and swim to the people below, when in reality, you could walk across the pool safely. 

7. Nelson Mandela
 Viewed from its side, this sculpture appears to be nothing special. It is simply a collection of black poles or pipes. However, if you view them from the correct angle, they form the face of Nelson Mandela, a famous politician from South Africa. The sculpture can be found in South Africa, on the same spot where Mandela was arrested. This illusion is both striking and powerful, made up of a total of fifty unattached columns.

6. Tree, Line
 Zander Olsen’s photography project had a simple enough idea: wrap the trunks of trees to blend in with the horizon line behind them. Who knew the effect would be so incredible? By creating this relationship between the horizon and the trees directly in front of the camera, Olsen blends foreground with background and almost seems to make the sections disappear entirely.

5. Hawaiian Waves
 The story behind this larger-than-life illusion goes that while the artist, John Pugh, was working on this mural, a fire truck pulled up in order to rescue the children standing above the door. He had painted the children staring in awe at the wave, but had not yet painted the stairs you see now. Would you believe us if we told you that, in fact, the entire side of the building you see is perfectly flat? Even the two square windows to the right of the wave are painted on and if you look closely enough, there is a man standing in the top window, peering out at the surfer!
 

4. Cup of Coffee
 Manfred Stader specializes in a type of art called hyperrealism. This giant illusion is a perfect example, you can almost smell the freshly brewed coffee. Through an amazing talent, he was able to make it look as though the cup is made of real porcelain and there really could be a giant metal spool balancing on the saucer. In reality, the only real thing about this cup of coffee are the coffee grounds Stader is pouring across the foam.
 

3. Russian Caves
 As part of a series, Edgar Muller turned the streets of major cities into gorgeous lake-filled caverns. Covering over 100 square meters, this incredible illusion is another testament to Muller’s work. With this series of nature-inspired illusions, Mueller makes the viewer feel as though they can see right into the center of the Earth. 
 

2. Flying Tree
 Many street artists make attempts to add to their environments, but Daniel Siering and Mario Shu are taking something away. These incredibly talented street artists have used foil and cans of plain, old spray paint to create this fascinating illusion. By painting the image of the cloudy sky on the midsection of the tree, which has been covered in tin foil, these artists give the illusion that this massive tree is floating in midair. 
 

1. The Grass Globe
 This illusion, designed by François Abélanet, is so well-executed that even after some careful study, it is still difficult to figure out. Although it appears compact, the globe park is actually a massive installation, spanning over 300 feet in length. It took 90 people and five days to complete. It was designed using the idea of anamorphosis, which requires it to be viewed only from one, particular angle in order to look normal. From any other angle, this jaw-dropping illusion appears to  be a segmented grass dog park.",Arts and Music

兵者，詭道也。故能而示之不能，用而示之不用，近而示之遠，遠而示之近
""All Warfare is Based on Deception""
- 孫子(Sun Tzu)


The Art of War
by Sunzi (c. 554BC -- c. 496 BC)
Translated by Lionel Giles (1875-1958).

    ""The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise written during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time. The Art of War is one of the oldest and most famous studies of strategy and has had a huge influence on both military planning and beyond. The Art of War has also been applied, with much success, to business and managerial strategies.""

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Arts and Music

As technological advances mean that digital innovations are now pervading many more areas of our lives, the arts industry is starting to take the work of artists working in the digital realm increasingly seriously.

In the wake of the growing debate and critical examination of digital art, the British Council commissioned this short film, produced by Dezeen, to ask: What is Digital Art? And why should we pay attention to it?

The film features interviews with 15 Folds founders Margot Bowman and Sean Frank, curator and writer Conrad Bodman, and artists Jon Thomson and Alison Craighead.

… The business of being an artist and working with galleries
Alan K. Avery, owner  Alan Avery Art Company

Thank you to Charles Mitchell at Think Free Films for the video and editing! 

             
Art School: Is it worth it?
o You can learn artistic rules on the Internet, by job shadowing or joining an artist co-op. 
o You have to learn composition, perspective, anatomy, and color theory to become a successful artist. 
o You have to learn the rules in order to break them. 

Assessment of your talent: Why do you create your artwork? 
o Photorealism is a technique and anyone can learn a technique. 
o Great artwork is when you can bring incredible ideas and creativity together with incredible technique. 
o Have reasons and inspiration behind your artwork. 
Finding a Gallery
o There is a gallery for every artist. 
o Networking is the most valuable tool you have as an artist. 
o Be out in the artistic community and be seen. 
Challenging yourself 
o Being the top artist in a gallery is not necessarily the best for your career, long term. If you don’t challenge yourself, you will not experience growth as an artist. 
o Being around other great artists helps to elevate your work. 
• Rotating your artwork
o Rotate your artwork a minimum of three times per year in a gallery setting. 
o Keeping the gallery inventory fresh will benefit your chances of being show to collectors. 
Pricing
o You have to pay your dues, start low and work your way up the ladder. 
Social Media
o Once you start getting a collector base, they will find you on social media. 
o Put your best self forward, don’t air politics on social media. 
The Business of Art
o An art dealer has the lowest profit margin of any business , a 50/50 split with the artists is not unfair. 
o Galleries have to figure in the cost of running a gallery, hosting events and openings, and paying a staff. All of which comes from their 50% . 
o Discounting artwork devalues the art for the rest of the collection. 
o Many people have not been in an art gallery before. It is the gallery’s job to make people feel comfortable by speaking to and informing them about the art. 
Signing with a Dealer: Is it necessary?
o It depends on the type of career you want. You can show at art festivals, sell your work online, or sign with a gallery. 
o Brick and mortar galleries will stay in business regardless of the Internet. 
Serious collectors want in person advice for purchasing artwork
o Do not sign with an art dealer until you have gotten to know them and know it is the right gallery and experience for you. Research the gallery and the art dealer. 
Contracts
o They exist for a reason, to protect everyone involved. The reason for a contract is because an art dealer has been burned in the past and needs to protect their interests for the future. The same goes for artists, the contract is also there to protect your interests.  
o If you do not understand terms in a contract, ask the dealer for clarity. If you see something you don’t like in your contract, you can ask for a revision to suit your needs. Make sure that your contract is an agreement between you and your art dealer. Make sure to read your entire contract. Does the contract deal with insurance coverage, who pays for shipping, and payment dates if a work sells? 
o Know what your rights are before you approach a gallery. You have the rights to your work and how you are represented.

190,ZcFRfJb2ONk,Teaching art or teaching to think like an artist? | Cindy Foley | TEDxColumbus,"What is the purpose and value of Art education in the 21st Century? Foley makes the case the Art’s critical value is to develop learners that think like Artists which means learners who are creative, curious, that seek questions, develop ideas, and play.  For that to happen society will need to stop the pervasive, problematic and cliché messaging that implies that creativity is somehow defined as artistic skill. This shift in perception will give educators the courage to teach for creativity, by focusing on three critical habits that artist employ, 1. Comfort with Ambiguity, 2. Idea Generation, and 3. Transdisciplinary Research. This change can make way for Center’s for Creativity in our schools and museums where ideas are king and curiosity reigns.

Cindy Meyers Foley is the Executive Assistant Director and Director of Learning and Experience at the Columbus Museum of Art. Foley worked to reimagine the CMA as a 21st century institution that is transformative, active, and participatory. An institution that impacts the health and growth of the community by cultivating, celebrating and championing creativity. Foley envisioned and led the charge to open the 18,000 sq. ft. Center for Creativity in 2011. In 2013, the museum received the National Medal for Museums in recognition of this work. Foley guest edited and wrote chapters for Intentionality and the Twenty-First-Century Museum, for the summer 2014 Journal of Museum Education.

In 2012, Foley received the Greater Columbus Arts Council Community Arts Partnership award for Arts Educator. She was a keynote speaker for the OAEA (Ohio Art Education Association) 2012 Conference. She is on the Faculty of Harvard University’s Future of Learning Summer Institute.

Foley is a graduate of the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University. Prior to joining the Museum, she was with the Institute of Contemporary Art at the Maine College of Art, the Portland Museum of Art, and the Wexner Center for the Arts.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Arts and Music
191,MJ9qSv5og_8,THIS MAKEUP ARTIST IS A MASTER OF BODY PAINT ILLUSIONS,"Mirjana Milosevic is a talented makeup artist from Serbia who creates amazing body paint illusions and is known by the nickname Kika.

Mirjana's parents said that she learned to draw before she learned to walk. She was drawing every day and on any surface that was available. When Mirjana was 11, her sister's friend asked her to draw a cartoon characters mural on his wall. The result was awesome, and she felt really happy doing it. 

She grew up in a country that was struck by war and it was a really hard time, so her parents couldn’t arrange for her to go to an artistic school. Mirjana spent all of her free time after school on improving her skills. 

Three years after graduation from high school, Mirjana gave birth to her son, Danilo, and motherhood gave her the strength she needed to start doing what she’d always wanted to do.

Mirjana became the most popular kids’ muralist in her country, but because of an accident with her spine she took a break. Doctors told her this was essential if she wanted to have more children.

In 2012, Mirjana gave birth to her second child, Nikola. Nikola inspired her to start doing kids face-painting, and she was very successful in that as well.

After that, she completed a basic makeup course and became interested in special effects makeup and body-painting. Now Mirjana is a fantastic body paint artist and creates amazing illusions.

She has won a lot of awards for her skills:

2015 – The Festival of Serbian Fantastic Film – The Oskull Award;

2015 - 3rd place at the International Face-Painting Competition in Serbia; 

2016 - 1st place and beauty vlogger of the year, NYX Face Awards Serbia competition;

2017 - 1st place at the International Face-Painting Competition in Serbia; 

Mirjana Kika Milosevic is one of the top ten illusionists in the world. Her makeup illusion videos are very popular on YouTube.

200,lNI07egoef,Why is Modern Art so Bad?,"For two millennia, great artists set the standard for beauty. Now those standards are gone. Modern art is a competition between the ugly and the twisted; the most shocking wins. What happened? How did the beautiful come to be reviled and bad taste come to be celebrated? Renowned artist Robert Florczak explains the history and the mystery behind this change and how it can be stopped and even reversed.

Script:

""The Mona Lisa""...  ""The Pieta""...  ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring.""  For a score of centuries, artists enriched Western society with their works of  astonishing beauty.  ""The Night Watch""...  ""The Thinker""...  ""The Rocky Mountains."" Master after master, from Leonardo, to Rembrandt, to Bierstadt, produced works that inspired, uplifted, and deepened us. And they did this by demanding of themselves the highest standards of excellence, improving upon the work of each previous generation of masters, and continuing to aspire to the highest quality attainable.

But something happened on the way to the 20th Century. The profound, the inspiring and the beautiful were replaced by the new, the different, and the ugly.  Today the silly, the pointless, and the purely offensive are held up as the best of modern art. 

Michelangelo carved his ""David"" out of a rock.  The Los Angeles County Museum of Art just offers us a rock, -- a rock -- all 340 tons of it.  That's how far standards have fallen.  How did this happen?  How did the thousand-year ascent towards artistic perfection and excellence die out?

It didn't.  It was pushed out.  Beginning in the late 19th century, a group dubbed The Impressionists rebelled against the French Academie des Beaux Arts and its demand for classical standards.  Whatever their intentions, the new modernists sowed the seeds of aesthetic relativism -- the ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" mentality.

Today everybody loves the Impressionists.  And, as with most revolutions, the first generation or so produced work of genuine merit.  Monet, Renoir, and Degas still maintained elements of disciplined design and execution, but with each new generation standards declined until there were no standards.  All that was left was personal expression.  

The great art historian Jacob Rosenberg wrote that quality in art ""is not merely a matter of personal opinion but to a high degree . . . objectively traceable."" But the idea of a universal standard of quality in art is now usually met with strong resistance if not open ridicule.

""How can art be objectively measured?"" I'm challenged.  In responding, I simply point to the artistic results produced by universal standards compared to what is produced by relativism.  The former gave the world ""The Birth of Venus"" and ""The Dying Gaul,"" while the latter has given us ""The Holy Virgin Mary,"" fashioned with cow dung and pornographic images, and ""Petra,"" the prize-winning sculpture of a policewoman squatting and urinating -- complete with a puddle of synthetic urine.

Without aesthetic standards we have no way to determine quality or inferiority.  Here's a test I give my graduate students, all talented and well educated.  Please analyze this Jackson Pollock painting and explain why it is good.  It is only after they give very eloquent answers that I inform them that the painting is actually a close up of my studio apron.  I don't blame them; I would probably have done the same since it's nearly impossible to differentiate between the two.

Our AI Generated Episode:


From drawing machines to early digital art and now AI, we’ve wondered whether the fundamentally human seeming endeavor of ART MAKING can be done by machines. At Idea Channel, we think the answer is unequivocally, yes! Perhaps the better question would be, will we ever let machines make art on their own? Will we ever be able to scrub away the influence and bias of the humans that created the machines making said art? And if so, how will we respond to the art being made by machines? How will it be appreciated? Will AI produced works ever be treated as art is traditionally treated–widely traded, curated, collected, critiqued? Let us know what you think in the comments below!

244,XwFFjO_6YK,30 DRAWING TRICKS YOU'LL WANT TO TRY RIGHT AWAY,"HOW TO DRAW 3D PICTURES

Have you ever wondered how to make your drawings pop and come to life? Learn how to draw 3D steps with ME!

1.Start by sketching a rectangle. Draw two vertical lines, making sure the spacing on the left side is slightly wider than the space on the right. Draw another vertical line about the same length as the first. Draw a diagonal line and a horizontal line like in the image.

2. Repeat this process to continue the staircase. Make sure all of the diagonal lines are parallel to one another.

3. Continue this process to the far right side of the rectangle.

4. Trace around the image with a darker pencil or pen, and erase all unwanted pencil marks. Fill the top area with black.

5. With a pencil, lightly sketch in a second set of steps on the left side. The illusion still works without these extra steps, but they will add extra effect. Trace around them with a darker pencil or pen.

6. Add some shading to the narrow rectangular shapes, like in the image. Fill in the bottom side with black.

7. Spin your paper approximately 45 degrees to the right. Sit back and see the illusion!

About TEDx, x = independently organized event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)",Arts and Music

They spoke at TEDxFargo about the benefits of letting go and living a meaningful life with less. For more info about The Minimalists visit

249,46WZ18yhHI,ART SUPPLIES THAT AREN'T WORTH THE MONEY | REVIEWING BAD ART SUPPLIES!?,"▼ OPEN ME FOR SUPPLY LIST & MORE ▼

In this video I talk about the supplies that I don't think are worth the money, either they're just plan bad art supplies, or they just cost way too much for the quality you get. Hopefully this helps you learn what not to buy, or helps you with any decisions you're trying to make!

So obviously certain prices have changed since I filmed this video! I also found some cheaper listings for some of the supplies - a notable one is the Sakura Koi Watercolor Field Sketch Set - I was actually able to find a listing that is CURRENTLY at $15.83, so that obviously brings the price down a lot! I also found the Factis Eraser on DIck Blick for $.99 & have listed that link instead. NO idea why I didn't think to check/cross reference prices there. Remember prices change especially online so obviously do your research and shop around before you purchase anything! Finally a wonderful commenter has let me know that the 9x12 pad of the Bee Watercolor Paper isn't the 100% cotton - I have not personally tried that one, so I can't attest to it. However, I have added a link to the 6x9 that I have that IS 100% cotton - that one I can 100% vouch for. It is roughly $13 for 50 6x9 watercolor sheets.

253,jnS66SszwE,The art of seduction | Seema Anand | TEDxEaling,"The ancient arts of Courtesanery and Seduction were once treated as high philosophy, with divine and academic associations. Dr. Seema Anand explores how these narratives have been lost and in the evolution of their vocabulary, the implications have changed. Working with the range of what 'story' can mean to an individual Seema facilitates the learning processes of 'telling', 'listening', 'acknowledging' and 'rejecting' the narratives that make up our lives and our social interactions to enhance communication, build links and open dialogue. 

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Arts and Music

255,N0u04EqNVj,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. 


Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).

In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.

The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.

On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtv

In 2002, the painting went on public exhibition alongside an undisputedly genuine version of Sunflowers, raising once again the questions so vividly posed in this film.

274,zNrEFpkgWQ,"""Mastering the Art of Manifesting"" Wayne Dyer at Wanderlust's Speakeasy","The greatest gift you have been given is the gift of your imagination. Everything that now exists was once imagined. And everything that will ever exist must first be imagined. Wayne Dyer's ""Wishes Fulfilled: Mastering The Art of Manifesting""  at the Wanderlust Festival Speakeasy in Squaw Valley 2012 was an event that everybody who attended couldn't stop talking about: it offered a voyage of discovery, complete with tools to begin to tap into the amazing manifesting powers that you possess within you and create a life in which all that you imagine for yourself becomes a present fact.

""You must be able to get to this place in your life where you don't use the evidence of your senses. What your eyes tell you, what your ears tell you, what your stomach tells you. You want to be able to be in a place where you are living from the end as if what you would like to manifest is already there. To make a future dream a present fact you must assume the feeling of that wish as already being filled.""

Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explores the region of your highest self; and definitively shows you how you can truly change your concept of yourself. By practicing the specific technique for retraining your subconscious mind, Dr Dyer encourages you to not only place into your imagination what you would like to manifest for yourself, but you are invited to get into the specifics for realigning your life so you can live out your highest calling and stay connected to your Source of being. From the lofty perspective of your highest self, you will learn how to train your imagination in a new way. Your wishes, all of them, can indeed be fulfilled.

Wayne W. Dyer, PH.D., is an internationally renowned author and speaker in the field of self-development. He's the author of over 30 books, has created many audio programs and videos, and has appeared on thousands of television and radio shows. Many of his books have been New York Times bestsellers including ""10 Secrets for Success and Inner Peace"", ""Excuses Begone"",  and ""Wishes Fulfilled"". Dyer holds a Doctorate in Educational Counseling from Wayne State University and was an associate professor at St. John's University in New York. Today he is affectionately called the ""father of motivation"" by his fans. 

To learn more about Wayne, you can visit his website at  and check out his books available for purchase here: . Follow Wayne on Facebook here:  and twitter @DrWayneWDyer ().

Wanderlust Festival is also indebted to Hay House () who helped us realize the entire 2012 Speakeasy Lecture Series across all four festivals (Stratton, VT in June 2012; Copper Mountain, CO in July; Squaw Valley, CA in late July; and Whistler, BC, Canada in August). With Hay House's amazing roster of speakers (which you can witness in person at their incredible ""I Can Do It"" events), it's no wonder that they helped elevate the conversation at Wanderlust's Speakeasy this summer. We encourage you to stay tuned to the Hay House FB feed to make sure you know the next time one of their authors is speaking near you ().

We tasted a few amazing dishes, bright and early!

First up, for breakfast, we found a lady selling this incredible milk cheese, kind of like curdled milk, right on the street. You can eat it plain or you can order it fried for breakfast with a lot of sugar. We ended up trying both. 

Then, we walked down the street and had a nice and hearty and healthy lunch soup, and rice as well. Super tasty and delicious!

Then we went for a walk and found some street ""huajuan"" rolls stuffed with fermented tofu, very strong and pungent!

All of this was found during the weekly farmers market on the street in Shaxi every friday! If you come to Yunnan in Southern China, come to Shaxi on a friday to visit one of the most amazing street markets! You have to come check it out!

After that, we went for a lunch and tasted classic bai cuisine, including local Matsutake mushrooms and amazing salted pork, which kind of tasted like pastrami! So delicious!!

We were in Guilin during the Clothes Drying Festival. This is the most significant festival of the year for the Yao People, an ethnic minority group that lives a self-sustaining lifestyle in the mountains here. We were fortunate enough to experience the daily life, customs, and traditions of these people during our stay.

My friend Adan joins us for his first appearance in a Monkey Abroad production. He is not only an amazing dancer and performer, but he made the music for this video ()
Also, be sure to check out Adan's YouTube page:

You already know Raven from the Nanjing and Wuxi videos (Traveling for 20 Dollars a Day). She's becoming a staple in the Monkey Abroad videoz. The only person we were missing this time was Curtis!

It's one of the craziest things I've done but so worth it. There's also the Yellow River, Hukou Waterfalls, the Ancient Walled City of Xian, Muslim Quarter, and so much more.

295,jeI3Ni7m46g,China Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination China.
China’s Imperial City is located in the centre of its ancient Middle Kingdom, a gigantic and inscrutable empire beyond the Great Wall. The Imperial City is entered through the Gates of Heavenly Peace.After seven years of construction, Ming Emperor Zhu Di moved into his newly-established palace complex in which over eight thousand people lived in almost a thousand rooms. The palace served as both a residential and governmental seat to the emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. A stone’s throw away from the old Summer Palace is the Garden of Harmonious Unity that was the favourite garden of the Emperor’s household who retreated to its cool lakeside shores during the humid months of summer. Close to Badaling the Great Wall Of China extends majestically across misty mountains. It is the largest Man-made structure in the world and was erected to protect the country from invasion from the North. The gigantic wall represented the division of two very different cultures. On one side the Central Asian Nomads and on the other the highly developed civilisation of the emerging Chinese Empire. Shanghai is a Gigantic City and a meeting point of both east and west. The shoreline is without a doubt the city’s main focal point and is a combination of past, present and future and contains the historic monuments and eye catching buildings of a great city. Famous explorer Marco Polo referred to Suzhou as the ‘Venice of the East’, a city that is particularly famous for its gardens. Many of its extremely elegant buildings are remnants of a glorious past. Yunnan´s most famous site is the unique Stone Forest Of Shi Lin, a forest of rock that extends for 27,000 hectares. Hong Kong is a city of the superlative with glimmering skyscrapers that seem to take root in the sky and one elegant building after another with shining glass and hi-tech facades. China is a world within a world!

This is what you need to know about travelling in China. How much things cost. How to get around. How you can travel off the beaten path. I find China a difficult country to travel. The language barrier has a greater impact than most other destinations. In this video, I discuss hotels, food, and transportation - including what to expect and how you can make your trip go smoothly. 

Have you traveled China? Did you like it? Did you find it more difficult than other countries?

304,5ky6vgQfU24,The Longest Way 1.0 - walk through China and grow a beard! - a photo every day timelapse,"GET MERCH: http://shirts.thelongestway.com

In 2008, I walked through China - 1 year, 4500km. I let my hair and my beard grow. This is the resulting video. UPDATE: ▶ I have decided to continue my walk home from China to Germany. I'm currently in Georgia, or about halfway through.I post daily videos on this channel, and I blog about it here: 

ABOUT THIS VIDEO:
▶ I didn't finish my original goal of walking to Germany in 2008. Instead, I walked for a year and roughly 4500km, passed the Gobi desert, and then decided to stop walking.
▶ All of the distance from Beijing to Ürümqi was completed solely on foot, straight good old walking. There are instances where you can see me in the video sitting on a plane or riding a boat, but those are during breaks I had to take from walking, either to sort out bureaucracy issues or to take care of some personal things.
▶ I had been planning this trip for over a year before I even started, and getting as far as I got was an experience for which I am very grateful.
▶ Obtaining the necessary visa for a trip like this was not very easy, hence I had to go back to Beijing a few times to resolve some issues.
▶ This is not a strict ""1 pic a day"" video, because I wanted to make it a bit more alive by adding some additional movement. Sometimes during the film you would follow me turn around, or something would happen in the background. I tried to capture these moments to make the video more interesting.
▶ If you liked the music I used in this video, get it here: The Kingpins - ""L'Aventurier""  Zhu Fengbo - ""Olive Tree"" 
▶ The core of this project is in actually my blog where I have posted my extensive travel diary, starting from day 1 (Nov 9th 2007) and describing every single day until the end one year later.

321,gQrY8mmQYC,"Shanghai, China: Traveling for $20 A Day - Ep 1","We traveled to Shanghai, China and visited People's Square, ate delicious Chinese street food all day and booked a room in a hostel - all for less than 20 dollars (130 RMB)!

This is the FIRST EPISODE of the Traveling for 20 Dollars a Day series. We now have visited citied all over Asia - including Bangkok, Beijing, Taipei, Phnom Penh, Saigon, and so many more! Check out my channel to follow the adventure.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost to travel Shanghai for the day:

Meals:
For breakfast, I bought two baozi buns for 3 RMB (1.5 RMB apiece). After that, I bought pineapple on a stick from a roadside vendor for 5 RMB.

For lunch, I ate at Yang’s Fried Dumplings, a famous chain that serves up amazing Sheng Jian Bao. That meal cost me 8 RMB.

For dinner, I ate YangZhou fried rice (18 RMB) and had a beer (12 RMB), which totaled out to 30 RMB.

Transportation:
As far as transportation goes, the underground public transit system (the Metro) is connected to virtually every part of the city and you can travel from one end of the city to another for less than a dollar. Throughout the day, I only spent 6 RMB ($1) on transportation!

Accommodation:
A standard dorm room bed at the Shanghai City Central Youth Hostel cost me 70 RMB.

Total cost today: 
123 RMB ($19)


About Me:

My name is Kevin Cook. I'm originally from Dallas, TX, but I've been living and traveling in Asia since 2013.

After graduating from university in 2011 and working a few unfulfilling jobs, I saved enough money to move to Asia and work as a teacher for a few years. That opportunity allowed me to travel around and experience new foods and cultures, and ignited a passion for blogging and making videos.

Now I travel full-time and make videos with the goal that I can encourage YOU to pursue your own dream of overseas traveling and living.

325,0ccRCAKGTS,China Business Trip Vlog | Shenzhen | Part 1,"I have been on China Business Trip for several weekends in a row, so I made a vlog out of my business traveling. First stop, Shenzhen. Ep 41⬇See more below⬇

Past weeks I have not been uploading many videos since I have been busy traveling for work. This video is the first one in the vlog series of China business trip. My first business trip travel destination is Shenzhen, China. Shenzhen is a city located next to Hong Kong, in Southern China. Travel to Shenzhen from Beijing takes about 3,5 hours by flight. 

Work in China has been really interesting by far as life in China in general. This is my first business trip in China and I am very excited to travel for work. The downside of business trips, especially if you have to travel during the weekends, is that you don't get to rest. But, in this video I am still at the beginning of my traveling, so I am very much enjoying my first ever China business trip.

Business trips can also be a good chance to learn Chinese. During these past weeks of traveling, I have noticed that many people I meet through work do not speak English or prefer speaking Chinese. I am also very happy to practice my Chinese while traveling for business. 

This travel to Shenzhen vlog is followed by another China business rip vlog episode so make sure to check it out once it's out!

328,7xnDvjJP1WA,China High Speed Trains - China Train Travel (part 2),"China has the largest network of high speed (bullet) trains in the world. The major investments of the last several years are expected to continue as most area of China will be covered over time. 
There are two categories of high-speed trains: G trains and D trains. These letters refer to the prefixes of the train number like G650 or D325. G trains are the fastest with speed up to 350km/h while D trains have speeds of up to 250km/h. Some D trains are overnight trains with sleeper compartment. These trains are covered in a different video. This video is strictly about day trains.
China's bullet trains offer a selection of classes of travel. Most common is 2nd class. 
These trains' 2nd class seat are more comfortable than economy seats on flights with much better leg space. Seats are 42-43cm wide (17 inches) with leg space of 40cm (16 inches). These seats have a 2+3 configuration.
1st class seats are more comfortable with thicker seats in a 2+2 configuration. These seats are 47cm wide (19 inches) with leg space of 40 to 50cm (16-20 inches) depending on the train model. 
The best seats are Business class. With a configuration of 2+1, the individual seats have many features, the best one being multiple controls of the seat position allowing the make the seat completely flat. Sometimes a snack is also served.
Our video does not cover the VIP class. This is only offered on a few trains. The seats are similar to 1st class but in a 2+1 configuration. These seats are expensive and offer poor value in our opinion. 
A last class of service available on only some trains is the ""Standing Ticket"". You can sometimes purchase these on sold out trains.
Remember that you can check schedules and ticket availability on our website www.china-diy-travel.com",travel

334,9bluhw3nPaE,Why Travel China by High Speed Bullet Trains?,"http://www.modelbuildings.org I'm the first to admit how much rail travel has improved in China. I remember using China Railways back in the early 1980's and the trains just crawled along at a snails pace and they were always late. How things have changed as you'll see in this video. China now has the longest high speed bullet train network in the world and it is rapidly expanding. 

The Chinese bullet trains, which rocket along at 300kp/h to 310 kph, are extremely comfortable and offer travellers a choice of Business Class, First Class, or Second Class (all are good). You hardly know you are moving as the trains are very quiet and smooth running (no clackity clack like on the old trains). The trains and stations are spotlessly clean and the train arrive and leave exactly on time. I never had a cancelled or delayed train. Fortunately the signs, tickets, and train announcements are in both Chinese and English, so it's not too confusing for a foreigner like me. 

I pre-purchased my tickets so the checkin proceedure was easy. You enter the railway station (the stations are giant concrete and marble structures), and proceed through security (justr like the security checks at airports). The process takes 3 to 4 minutes at most. At most stations you then go up an esculator to the first floor where there is a giant waiting area and where the boarding gates are located. At Shanghai Railway Station I counted 24 gates and from memorary Beijing Railway Station had about the same number. The boarding gates are all clearly numbered just like at an airport, and there are big digital signs listing all the train departures with destinations, platform number, boarding gate number, departure time etc. The boarding gates open 15 minutes before departure and close about 5 minutes before departure. The bullet trains won't wait for anyone, so if you are not on time you miss your train. All the relevant information incluing the car and seat number is on your rail ticket. When boarding you go down the esculator to the platform (only ticket holders are allowed on the platform). The car numbers are painted on the platform and the bullet train will stop exactly on the right spot. This speeds up boarding as everyone is lined up at the correct car before the train arrives.

You can either put your luggage on the rack above your seat or store it at the end of the carriage, so there is no waiting at a luggage carousel. The bullet trains stop at a limited number of station on the journey and depart about 1 minute after arriving. Views out the windows are a bonus as you get to see the real China (smog and all!). I must admit I am biased towards train travel, but I was very impressed with the efficiency and cleanliness of the service. It is a great way to tour China.",travel

341,81IdbVIogY,Beijing Vacation Travel Video Guide • Great Destinations,"The Chinese is one of the worlds oldest civilizations. The capital, Beijing with its 11 million inhabitants is now a modern city with skyscrapers, highways and shopping malls. Its several ancient monuments are all oases of silence. The Tien’anmen square is possibly the largest and most famous square of the world. The former imperial palace, surrounded by wall was called ‘the forbidden city’ because a commoner could not enter here. At least that beautiful is the Summer Palace and the Temple of Heaven, where pieces from the ancient artist await the visitors. When in Beijing, one must not forget the Buddhist temples, and the zoo, where the very rare panda bears are living. Let us not forget about the gastronomical part of China, since the country’s cuisine is one of the best on Earth. From Beijing we can travel to the old capital, Xian, where the famous clay soldiers can be seen. The Ming Dinasty Tombs are only 50 kilometres far from Beijing, but the Great Wall of China is not far either.

342,QloiIyGCpX4,China Train Travel,"As of 2015, China has 121,000 km (75,186 mi) of railways, the second longest network in the world.
High-speed rail service in China was introduced on April 18, 2007 and has become immensely popular with an annual ridership of over 1.1 billion in 2015, making the Chinese high-speed rail network the most heavily used in the world. China has the world's longest high-speed rail network with as of September 2016 over 20,000 km (12,000 mi) of route in service that is part of the network of newly built passenger-dedicated lines, a length that is more than the rest of the world's high-speed rail tracks combined.
Its on-time record makes it a transport alternative that is much more reliable than air travel that is very often delayed in China.
Tickets can generally be purchased 60 days prior to the travel date. Most popular routes are often sold out and getting tickets is a major challenge when traveling during major Chinese holiday.
China DIY Travel will help you secure tickets but will also advise you on planning the most efficient route and best trains to make your trip a memorable one. Consult our website to up-to-date real-time schedules.

345,YOYk7nX,My Trip to China VLOG - Episode #1 | Traveling Solo,"Hey there!! 

Welcome to Episode #1 of my vlog series to Beijing, China! It's been 2 YEARS and I'm finally making my travel videos :) In November of 2016, I started my trip out in Beijing, where I spent four days visiting my friend Sarah (A solo traveller of the world) who inspired me to come and visit her. I left by faith paying all of my SAVINGS$$$ to go on this trip and I got to explore the city, the food, the history and the Forbidden City. IT WAS AMAZING!!! Traveling alone for the first time internationally across the world all by myself was the greatest adventure of a lifetime!

I hope my vlog inspires in you the sense of awe and wonder that it inspired in me :)

Lanzhou is the capital of Gansu province 

Lanzhou is an industrial city of about three million people. It is located on the shores of the Yellow River and was a major stop on the Silk Road, where it was known as the Golden City. From the 5th to the 11th century the city was a major seat of Buddhist learning, and it acquired its present name during Qing Dynasty in 1656. Until 19th century, Lanzhou was the primary point in crossing the Yellow River via a bridge made by chaining a flotilla of boats together with a road on top to cross on.

Lanzhou is no longer one of the most polluted cities in China since 2010. The environment has been improved significantly. There was a lot of industry here, and reasonably remote but well paid teaching opportunities.

380,iCvI6FXqig,"Great Wall, Badaling - China Travel Channel","The Great Wall of China 中國長城, here seen at Badaling, is no doubt one of the major highlights of a trip to China. There is varying information available on the actual length of the wall. Normally, a length of 6800 km is assumed. The start of wall construction reach back to 656 AD, when the Chu Empire erected the first wall as a defense against the State of Qi. Following unification of the Empire, the first Chinese Emperor Qinshi had the initial wall section connected to a common wall. At times there were up to 100,000 soldiers and 800,000 forced laborers involved in building the wall. If they died on the job, they were buried in the wall. Large sections of the wall later lost importance, as these sections ran through independent territory. 
Only during the Ming Dynasty was the wall completely restored and served as protection against the Mongolians who returned to the north after the Yuan Dynasty was toppled.

The wall’s importance was not just for defense purposes, however. The Great Wall was very important as a connecting road, a path of transport and communication and providing lodgings for troops and storage for weapons and munitions. In 1987, the Great Wall was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Die Grosse Mauer - 萬里長城, hier bei Badaling, gehört  zu den Höhepunkten einer Chinareise. Über die Länge der Mauern gibt es unterschiedliche Angaben. Meist geht man von einer Länge von 6.800 km aus. Die ersten Anfänge reichen bis 656 v.u.Z. zurück, als das Königreich Chu einen ersten Wall zur Verteidigung gegen den Staat Qi errichtete. Der erste chinesische Kaiser Qinshi ließ nach der Reichsvereinigung die ersten Mauerteile zu einer gemeinsamen Mauer verbinden. Zeitweise waren bis zu 100.000 Soldaten und 800.000 Zwangsarbeiter mit den Bauarbeiten beschäftigt, die im Todesfall in der Mauer begraben wurden. Später verloren weite Teile der Mauer ihre Bedeutung, da diese meist durch eigenes Territorium verliefen. Erst in der Ming-Dynastie wurde die Mauer wieder vollständig restauriert und diente zum Schutz gegen die Mongolen, die sich nach dem Sturz der Yuan-Dynastie nach Norden zurückgezogen hatten. 
Die Bedeutung der Mauer lag aber nicht nur in der Verteidigung; die grosse Mauer war wichtig als Verbindungsstraße, Transport- und Kommunikationsweg sowie als Unterkunft für Truppen und als Lager für Waffen und Munition.
1987 wurde die Grosse Mauer zum UNESCO-Weltkulturerbe erklärt

Explore China when you cruise the Yangtze River, which has been China's main thoroughfare for commerce and culture for centuries. Before your Chinese River Cruise begins, you'll stay in Beijing and tour the magnificent Forbidden City, imperial palaces, and the incredible Great Wall. Then, travel to the metropolis of Shanghai for a glimpse of modern life, as well as a look at artifacts from ancient dynasties.

You'll cruise through the Yangtze River Valley, home to misty mountains, breathtaking gorges, canyons, bamboo groves, whirlpools, and lagoons. Along the Yangtze River's narrow, cliff-bound passages lie some of China's greatest cultural treasures—ancient tombs, shrines, and walls from before the time of Christ.

After your Yangtze River Cruise, you'll discover China's World War II history in Chongqing, marvel at Xian's terra cotta army, and cruise Guilin's beautiful Li River.

ABOUT ME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi there!

I am Anissa Syifa Adriana, otherwise known as Syifa. I am a conversation connoisseur, Indonesian female solo traveler and make-up enthusiast. I started my first solo traveling in June 2014, a coincidence trip, where it was intended for someone I was very close to in the past. I never regret deciding to go because after that, I never look back. 

I decided to leave Indonesia since August 2016, to do a long-term traveling. After being on the road for about 5 months, in January 2017 I was offered to teach English in Yinchuan, Northwest China. Instead of going back home, at that time I went straight to China from Vietnam carrying only the remaining USD 300 that I had in my bank account. Arrived in China for the first time, everything felt so intimidating and foreign at the same time. Since then, I was based in Yinchuan, Northwest China and had been loving it.

As of now, I am back on the road again to travel and make videos on Youtube. Thank you again for watching! I hope you get to enjoy the video as much as I am making it.

Let's keep it positive. Don't forget to like, share, comment and subscribe :) 

Till next time!

394,60dyf7gdpYY,Travel by BULLET TRAIN in CHINA,"In this video I show you what it's like to travel by a bullet train (or high speed train) in China. My train ride was fairly short; I traveled from Chengdu East Station to Leshan.

Train stations in China are something special. They are generally very large and you can compare them with a small airport. 
Make sure you arrive early as the security can take up some time. 
The gate to the platform closes roughly 5 minutes before departure and then you're no longer allowed to get on the train.

I enjoy taking the bullet train in China. They are fast and reliable. Where domestic flights are often delayed, trains almost always depart on time.

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:
 
Amazing Hand Pulled Noodles 兰州七里河北滨河中路2168号 -吾穆勒蓬灰牛肉面

403,ESzhBgvLS8,Our Experience with Rewards Travel China and Groupon,"If you didn’t already know, my friend and I traveled to China last month on a Groupon getaway! I made this video to share our experience with Groupon travel + if we would do it again! 

About our Deal

Our tour was the 10 day China tour from Rewards Travel China, hosted on Groupon. We bought it as an all-inclusive tour -- it covered flights, hotels, several of our meals, major transportation, and many of our excursions. When you purchase a groupon getaway, it gives you several date options, as well as the airport you want to leave from, with different prices for each. If you are from a bigger city, you are more likely to see your home airport listed as an option. Little ole Lambert in St. Louis is hardly ever listed and this tour was no exception. We opted to purchase a tour leaving from Denver and decided to drive out for our flight. 

The Price 

Like I said, the tour was considered all inclusive and did cover most things, but there were a few things we had to cover on our own. We had to get a visa to go to China -- there was an option to add this into the package, but we opted to do it ourselves. We had to get ourselves to Denver and we had to cover some of our dinners while we there. We also decided to add a few of the optional excursions. The all-in total after I added up every single thing, came in at a just under $1,300.

The Verdict on Groupon Getaways

I know this is what everyone wants to know: Do I think you should try it? And would I do it again? Overall, my answer is YES. It was a success + I will definitely look into going to other destinations in the future! That being said, for as much as we loved it, I will not travel exclusively on Groupon getaways from here on out: I think it takes a certain kind of trip + traveler for it to be successful! 

Traveling on Groupon is for you if… 

You don’t want to plan your trip
For China, this was a big one. I don’t know the first thing about planning a trip to China. I obviously know the big attractions, like the Great Wall, but I don’t know which hotels are in safe areas or the best way to get from city to city. Purchasing the Groupon tour took care of all of that for me! 

You are overall a fairly optimistic and flexible traveler 
In order to travel in general, you need to be a pretty optimistic person that’s willing to go with the flow, but that is especially the case for Groupon travel. Some of the excursions booked on the tour won’t really be your cup of tea, but anything can be fun (or at the very least tolerable) if you have the right mindset! You have to be open-minded to trying new things, eating different foods, and seeing places you maybe wouldn’t have put on your itinerary. 

You want to see the highlights of a particular place on a budget 
Far and away, the biggest reason to travel with Groupon is the wide selection of destinations to visit for an unbeatable price! We got to see the major highlights of China and experience/learn about the culture, all for a price that two 20-somethings could afford. 

Traveling on Groupon isn’t for you if… 

You want control of your itinerary
If you are going to visit a family member or you have a list of specific things that you want to check out in a certain destination, I don’t think an all-inclusive tour would be best for you. There were some free days built into our time in China, but most of the trip was very structured. This is the reason why I won’t be taking tours to all the places on my bucket list: If I feel comfortable planning and booking a trip on my own, the control I gain is worth the extra hassle (and expense) of planning it out exactly how I want it to be. 

You have set dates that you need to travel within 
Like I mentioned earlier, Groupon gives you a set of dates to choose from when purchasing a tour. So, if you are only able to travel within specific dates, Groupon might not be the best option for you. We were able to make it work with Angela’s class schedule, so I am not saying that it’s impossible to get a date that works, I’m just saying you might be pressing your luck! 

You typically don’t like traveling in groups 
If you have tried traveling in groups before and didn’t love it, then Groupon tours might not be your best option. I have done several group trips and I love them, so I was excited for this aspect, but I have friends at home, who I know wouldn’t prefer traveling this way. Either way is totally fine, it really just comes down to knowing your personality type + knowing what you are comfortable with while traveling!",travel

This video deserves wayyy over a Million views! it got 500k+ hits on Vimeo but only 100k+ on youtube... it's also been re-posted on youtube by some smaller channels so.... figured I had to re-post it. It needs a revitalizing!!  So share it on facebook!


So i stumbled on this video in 2013 after a '2-weak' trip to Thailand and began to itch with the travel bug... and started watching lots of youtube to scratch the itch...

It was so mesmerizing at the time... and still is... the colors.. the cinematography... the music............ i remember thinking like, 'how do these colorful cities exists on the other side of the world and hardly even anyone knows they exist?!.... especially Guangzhou..... 4 years ago i didn't even know it existed... or was the 3rd largest city in China for that matter............... and now my life (and youtube) freaking took me here. Surreal. 

Cheers to the filmmaker Zweizwei for making this inspiring piece.

So far I have been to Japan and South Korea, China and Hong Kong on this trip, currently I’m in Vietnam. After Vietnam I am travelling to, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indionesia. Thats the plan anyway.

431,rlURVgX3e4k,"Traditional Chinese HuTongs! -Beijing, China-Travel Man Dan","#TravelManDan #BeiJingChina #Hutongs #Justakidfromkenmore

First I would like to wish all my Friends in China, and the Chinese people around the world a very HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR!! 
May you all have the best in HEALTH, HAPPINESS and PROSPERITY! This episode is very symbolic to me and the country of China because during CNY in today's adventure I travel to the traditional housing of Beijing know as the HuTongs!!!

In this episode of Travel Man Dan I am having a great time exploring one of coolest places in Beijing and all around China, the HuTongs are an exciting place of wonder and amazement that can take you back to feel like your in ancient China!
 
This video was shot to help people see what the inside area of this special section of Beijing looks like. Its the perfect example and right amount of old and new. The hosing structures are kept in excellent preservation and the streets are filled with modern shops and bustling with people all out to explore this unique housing district.

This episode was so much fun to film! Because I wandered around the central walkway with consistent amazement at the architecture of the buildings and how they were kept in harmony with nature. The shops along the roads are filled with people and lots of fun things to do, stuff to purchase, things to taste or just look at. Each Hutong housed a few families years ago and to just walk through this area is a wonderful feeling of history, and you can have an amazing time exploring all the fun stuff. 

In this episode you'll see how accommodating the Chinese people are to travelers. There is so much activity going on you must see it for yourself. In this episode you'll see the Beijing Opera training school, special tin and aluminum hand crafted artwork and the antique style of Chinese architecture. I had such a fantastic time here at the Hutongs and the shops and streets should be a must see, and I look forward to visiting this area and showing it off to you!

China will always be a part of my life, as once you live in an country it becomes very familiar and always brings a smile to my face when I think of the past and how much fun I had living here! I will miss China but I know Ill always return and I am looking forward to new adventures around the world. I do my best to document my VLOGS as true to myself and how I see things around the world, and here in China. The Beijing HuTongs are an absolute stunning sight to see and I suggest once in your life make the trip and see it for yourself!

Below is a link that you can read up on to gain more knowledge of the HuTongs and Chinese culture. I also added important info about traveling in China that you may find useful. Also be sure to check out the 5 part series I put out on Shanghai- as well as the previous episodes on the high speed train and the Great Wall-but as always I recommend you visiting yourself and going on your own epic adventure!

A cute ancient city, filled with hipster coffee shops and bars with live music. And so many things to do. It also has beautiful mountains, a stunning lake and some of the best temples in China. It's no wonder that it's a must see for anybody travelling through Yunnan. I hope you enjoy this travel guide!

SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL, it's the best way to support me and means I can keep making more content. I currently upload a new episode every Tuesday: 

TABLE OF CONTENTS (a list of all of the places featured in the video)

 - Bad Monkey bar in the Ancient Town
A great bar run by an English guy. They put on live music across their 2 venues in the city. Their own craft beer is really good too, it's a real cross between Camden and China!

 - Exploring the Ancient Town Streets
One of the best things to do in Dali is just walk the streets of the ancient town. You can spend a few hours wandering the paved streets, admiring the traditional architecture of the Bai ethnic minority, trying their local food and snacks, and buying some souvenirs. Dali is probably the most beautiful ancient town in Yunnan, only rivalled by Lijiang (which is much busier!)

 - Dali Ancient City Walls
There are 4 gates in the walls that protected the city of Dali, dating back 600 years to the Ming Dynasty and they are all really well preserved. The North Gate, East Gate, Southgate (it's coming home) and West Gate. We cycled around to see them all.

 - The Three Pagodas
The 3 Pagodas of the Chongsheng Temple are a must see in Dali. You can easily cycle there from the Ancient City and spent a couple of hours exploring the temple grounds and the various gardens and towers.

 - Lake Erhai
Erhai or Er Lake is an alpine fault lake outside the ancient city. Again, its very easy to cycle there. Its name means ""Ear-shaped Sea"", due to its shape. The second largest lake in the province after Dianchi Lake in Kunming (featured in the 3rd episode of the China Series)

 - Kanshan (Cangshan) Mountain
The Cang Mountains (Cangshan) are a mountain range west of Dali City. There are a few different options for cable cars to explore the heights of the mountain, we opted for the Qingbi Waterfall area. I have heard that the Horse Washing Pond is even more spectacular though.

If you have any other questions about this part of the trip or China in general, let me know in the comments - I reply to all of them!

Tianjin is a metropolis in northern China and one of the five national central cities of the People's Republic of China. It is governed as a direct-controlled municipality, one of four such designations, and is, thus, under direct administration of the central government. Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea.

As a dual-core city, Tianjin is divided into the old city and the Binhai New Area. Binhai New Area is a new growth pole in China, and it maintains an annual growth rate of nearly 30% of the GDP. As of the end of 2010, 285 Fortune Global 500 companies have established branch offices in Binhai. It is a base of China's advanced industry, financial reform, and innovation.

In urban population, the city ranks sixth in China and its urban land area (Binhai New Area is not included) is fifth after Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and Guangzhou. Tianjin's urban area is located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal in Tianjin. Tianjin was once home to foreign concessions in the late Qing Dynasty and early Kuomintang (KMT) era. The municipality incorporates the coastal region of Tanggu, home to the Binhai New Area and the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA). 

Parks in Tianjin, China
=================
Tianjin Water Park It is the largest urban park and recreation area in Tianjin. The recreation area of the Tianjin Water Park has one of the city's highest ferris wheels. Visitors are also encouraged to travel on the lakes via rowing boats and high speed water shuttles. The park changes its theme according to season, for example, during spring there is the Tulip Show, and in autumn there is the Chrysanthemum Show. 

Beining Park. This park could easily elevate to shrine status, especially during spring when the trees and flowers begin to bloom with incomparable color. Ponds and pavilions linked by 29 arch bridges suffuse the entire park with a keen sense of serenity, making it the ideal spot for a quick city escape. The park's main feature, the Zhiyuan Pagoda, extends 244 feet high. It can be scaled by either stairs or elevator. Carved murals on the pagoda's inside walls are worthy of attention too. 

Central Park. 

Seaside Amusement Park.

Soviet aircraft carrier Kiev Theme Park

Tianjin Zoo. The Tianjin Zoo is located in Nankai District, Tianjin, China, as the south-most part of the Water Park complex. Construction began in 1975 and it was opened to the public on January 1st, 1980. It houses approximately 3,000 animals of 200 species.

454,VjtDHM25xK,Vietnam to China BY BUS | China Travel Guide,"How To Travel From Vietnam To China By BUS.  The Vietnam China border can seem like a tricky one. China itself can seem daunting. But we assure you. IT'S NOT! 

Travelling from Vietnam to China by bus was one of the easiest land border crossing in Southeast Asia. 

  

If you want to travel from Vietnam to China by bus we suggest booking tickets over at https//www.baolau.vn. It was a super easy day. The bus was comfortable (there were only 3 of us) and it didn’t take more than 8 hrs total.

The border itself was a breeze. When crossing from Vietnam into China there was hardly any crowds which made it super easy. If your backpacking Vietnam and heading into China, we suggest this method of travel from Vietnam to China. It was  a far better choice than the 12+ hour train journey.

465,RK3mmtvqFQ,Don't Travel in China During a Holiday...,"I recently took a trip to Xi'an with my friend Johnathan. We travelled to this historic city during the National Day holiday which is about one week long. This is a time where Chinese people from all over the country make plans to travel and for a city like Xi'an, it was a nightmare at times.

Chinese people love to visit all the popular tourist attractions in large herds. This means unbearable lines and crowds that become a serious hazard. We went to the famous Terracotta Warriors, which is probably Xi'an's most popular attraction. It was an absolute nightmare. We couldn't enjoy the sight because of how many people were there. We were waiting in lines that eventually disintegrated into a mob of people pushing and shoving to get to the entrance.

This is what happens in China. Watch out for all the famous tourist attractions in China if you are travelling during a national holiday. Chances are they will be filled to the brim. That is why it is always a better idea to make sure you aren't travelling during a national holiday. Usually, these places aren't worth the hassle. A lot of times, these tourist attractions are over hyped and too expensive. It usually isn't worth all the lines, waiting and chaos that ensues when you travel at these times. Look for unique things to do when you travel in China. Check out a soccer/basketball game, go to a bathhouse or learn calligraphy. Do something out of the ordinary.

This is very crucial advice to anyone that wants to travel around this amazing country. Hope you enjoy my new China travel hack.

What to do, see, eat and experience in these vibrant Chinese cities. 

I had a whirlwind week in China with Wendy Wu Tours and I experienced so much in this exciting, ancient and modern country. From the skyscrapers of Shanghai, to biking the old wall of Xi'an, to seeing the Terra Cotta Warriors up close and exploring the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall—China was full of life changing moments. Here's a glimpse into what we did on our tour through this amazing country.
