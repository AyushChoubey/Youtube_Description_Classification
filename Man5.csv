19,ExxAim8aoQ,Samsung Quality Assurance and Safety S8│S8 +,"The Galaxy Note 7 turned out to be a massive failure. Even though it was a great device, it was a safety hazard due to faulty batteries. The company had to recall all the Galaxy Note 7 units it shipped worldwide, and apologize its customers. Samsung not only suffered an enormous financial loss due to this recall but also to endured its worst branding nightmare ever. Airlines reminded travelers for months that the Galaxy Note 7 was a safety threat, and it could catch fire at any moment.

Samsung clearly doesn’t want to go through the same painful situation once again, so it created a new 8-point battery safety check three months ago for improved product quality and safety. The newly released Galaxy S8 and S8+ pass through the same procedure, and the company says that it is doing everything it can to ensure highest product quality and safety. The devices go through massive charge and discharge tests, and the company is even inspecting battery suppliers for quality assurance.

The company wants to keep the whole testing procedure open, so it created a special battery analysis center that will be proactive in communicating with consumers. It is even taking help of external agencies and experts for improving its battery testing procedure even further. Samsung has released a new video that showcases how the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are tested in its factories to ensure the highest product quality and safety so that it can regain consumer confidence.",Manufacturing

22,gZPeyErbqz4,Inside Corning's Gorilla Glass Factory,"CNBC traveled to Harrodsburg, Kentucky to get a rare look inside Corning’s oldest glass factory where it makes Gorilla Glass for iPhones and a variety of other devices. The factory runs 24/7 and human hands never touch the glass — only air and robots. Take a look inside to see how it's made.

In the middle of bluegrass and bourbon country in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, is Corning's oldest glass factory. It was built in the 1950s to create lenses for glasses and then in the 1980s it transitioned into making LCD glass panels.

But about six months before the first iPhone was released in 2007, Steve Jobs made a call to the CEO of Corning and asked the company to create glass that could withstand scratches and breakage for a new Apple product. Before that, phones were typically covered in plastic. Corning quickly developed Gorilla Glass, and this factory went through a complete transformation.

The same company that developed the glass for the Edison bulb in 1879, is now making the glass that covers 6 billion smartphones, tablets, screens and wearables worldwide for Apple, Samsung, LG, Sony and Huawei and a variety of other manufacturers.

Watch the video to get a rare look inside the factory to see how Gorilla Glass is made.

37,RM33U1T9E5E,World's Largest Mobile Factory: All about it | ये है दुनिया की सबसे बड़ी मोबाइल फैक्ट्री | Tech Tak,"Samsung has opened its new mobile factory in India. This factory is said to be the world's largest mobile factory. 

The factory plot which is of 35-acre, is situated at Sector 81 in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and South Korean President Moon Jae will be officially inaugurating the Samsung Electronics factory on Monday. By opening the new factory, Samsung India aims to increase its overall production to 50 per cent in the next three years, which is currently at 10 per cent.

1. Samsung is currently making 67 million smartphones in India and with the new plant, the company is aiming to manufacture nearly 120 million mobile phones. Commenting on the new Samsung plant, Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research says that the new factory will reduce the time to market for Samsung.

""This will help Samsung bring some local features to the devices powered by R&D here. Apart from this, the company can also bring in export opportunity for Samsung to SAARC and other regions,"" Pathak told IANS.

2. Back in June 2017, the South Korean giant had announced a Rs 4,915 crore investment to expand the new Noida plant. It just a year after a new of the announcement, Samsung's Noida plant is all-ready to double production. By setting up the new plant Samsung is not only aiming to double its mobile phone production but other consumer electronics products as well, like refrigerators and flat panel televisions.

3. According to HC Hong, President and CEO, Samsung India, a bigger manufacturing plant will help the company cater to the growing demand for Samsung products across India.

4. Established in 1995, Samsung India laid the foundation for the Noida plant next year, 1996. In 1997, the production commenced and the first Samsung TV was rolled out to the market. It is in 2003 that the Samsung initiated the refrigerator production in the country. It is in just a couple of years, that is by 2005, Samsung had become the market leader in manufacturing TV panels.

In 2007, the existing Noida plat started manufacturing mobile phones. In 2012, Samsung became the leader in mobile phones in the country and the Noida facility rolled out the first-ever Galaxy S3 device. Today, Samsung is among the top mobile brands in India. With the new Noida plant Samsung is expecting to expand its mobile business in the country. To recollect, Samsung India has registered around 27 per cent growth in mobile business revenue for the financial year 2016-17.

5. Samsung currently has two manufacturing plants in the country -- one in Noida and the second one in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. There are five R&D centres, and one design centre in Noida, where somewhere over 70,000 people work.

66,JdygOO3YyY,Xiaomi Redmi 5 & 5 Plus Manufacturing & Testing Factory,"https://www.mi.com/in/about/

Xiaomi has set up a second factory in Andhra Pradesh’s Sri City, the company announced on the sidelines of its Redmi 4A launch in New Delhi. While Xiaomi hasn’t given the exact capacity number of the plant, the company claimed is was now manufacturing one phone per second in India.

For Xiaomi, though, this might not be enough given the supply constraints it continues to face here. Most of Xiaomi’s devices are sold out within seconds of becoming available online during the weekly sales. However, Xiaomi India head and Vice-President Manu Kumar Jain said this is a problem they intend to solve. “The key for us was to start hitting one phone per second kind and we thought we will announce it only when we hit that number. Now we are hitting that consistently,” he said in an interaction with IndianExpress.com.

Jain said the company had been looking to expand its production in India since 2016, even though he refused to confirm a number on the exact capacity of these plants. Xiaomi’s plants are operated by Foxconn and they employee over 5000 people. Xiaomi says 90 per cent of the employees are women.

But Jain admitted that with just one plant, Xiaomi was struggling to meet demand. “We were already running at 100 per cent utilisation, but we were not able to meet the demand. Even today, with Redmi Note 4, we have sold 1 million units in 45 days, but probably if we had more stock we could have sold more phones,” he added.

So far Xiaomi is selling four phones selling: Redmi 3S, which has two variants, Redmi Note 4 which has three variants, Mi Max which comes in two variants and the flagship Mi 5 phone from last year. Other than the Mi 5 imported from China, Xiaomi says all of its phones are made in India.

NEW DELHI: Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi plans to set up two manufacturing plants in India and launch more devices this year as it ramps up its presence in the world's fastest growing market amid a cooling in its home market. 

Bin Lin, billionaire co-founder and president at Xiaomi, told ET that he will be spending a lot more time in India, underlining the South Asian nation's importance amid challenges in its biggest market, China.
