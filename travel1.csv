2,zSHcyXfNP,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

7,AD8vRDaJWP,NAGALAND - DZUKOU VALLEY & JAKHAMA | Travelling in North-East India | Indian Travel vlogs,"Welcome To Nagaland! (3/3) DZUKOU VALLEY & JAKHAMA - The villages in Nagaland.

I visited Nagaland in the month of April and had the opportunity to open my mind to endless experiences! For the longest time, Nagaland and the whole of North East has been so neglected: tourism wise and also culturally :(. So I took the plunge to discover the beautiful state myself, with two other creators- Tanya Khanijow & Namrata Menon. These girls have been the most lovely to travel with :)
This is Part 2 of the Nagaland series ! there are 3 in total! please watch part 1 because it's super fun and features the cities - Dimapur & Kohima ( the capital of Nagaland)


üôèüôèThings to remember when you plan your travel:üôèüôè

üôèThe Visvema route (the one I took) is much easier compared to the Jakhama route. 

üôèYou can camp  the previous night at Campsite Yedika just like I did, before you trek to the valley.

üôèDrones are not allowed in the valley (we had special permissions to use them)

üôèYou can get in touch with @tirelessfoot_nicholas on Instagram, incase you're interested to trek to the valley. He's a good buddy, and will help you in the best way

üôèEntry to the valley is INR 20/- only

üôèCarry your sleeping bags and down jackets cuz it's super windy and extremely cold at night. I went in the month of April and it was super cold.

üôèThe best option would be to trek early in the morning and reach the dormitory by or before 2pm. 

üôèDO NOT trek to Dzukou without a local guide.


üôèYou need an ILP-(Inner Line Permit) to enter the state of Nagaland. You can apply here‚Äî  ... 

üôèCommute in the city is pretty straightforward. You can use the local rickshaws, or hire a car to go around. The roads are super bumpy especially in Dimapur & Kohima, so be prepared :D

üôèThe food scene is very much different than mainland. Vegetarians options are available, but make sure you mention you‚Äôre vegetarian since they also tend to cook their veggies in pork fat. Nagaland thrives on pork and beef, and a lot of things you don‚Äôt see in the rest of the country. I suggest that you visit with an open mind, else it will be super difficult to survive. I personally loved the food. :D

üôèMake sure you have enough cash on you. It‚Äôs advisable to carry cash from home since it was even hard to find ATMs. 

üôèHomestays are the best way to experience the local living. Since the people are super friendly, the hosts are lovely to interact with and know so many things about the Naga culture.

üôèDo a lot of research before you visit. The state has 16 different tribes and they speak different dialects. Read about their lifestyle and food. 

üôèCarry your rainwear and warm clothes since the weather is pretty unpredictable. The best time to travel according to me is December (for Hornbill festival ) and also April. 

üôèNagaland is a dry state! :P 

üôèNagaland is a state full of beauty and the nicest people I've ever come across. The misconceptions about this magic land are hilarious! So do not believe anything else you hear about this place. We stayed here for 10 days and had no issues, problems at all! Trust me! Your next travel, must be planned for the north-east especially NAGALANDDD! 


üíãAlso, thanks to Tanya and Namrata, for helping me film so many shots! 

This video, and the rest of the videos of the Nagaland series are in collaboration with Tanya Khanijow! and also in collaboration with the super talented cinematographer - Namrata Menon :* Love you my mungi :*

12,R7vmHGAshi8,How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko | TEDxTUHH,"Many people daydream about traveling the world, but all of them have the same excuse - lack of money. Tomislav, after traveling the world for years with almost no money, shows how it is possible for everyone to do the same, if they really want to.

Tomislav Perko, 29, is a travel writer from Croatia. After a career of a stockbroker, broke because of the financial crisis, he hits the road and turns it into his home. He uses alternative ways of traveling ‚Äì hitchhiking, couchsurfing, working/volunteering, and manages to wander around the world with just a little bit of money in his pocket, meeting the most amazing people on the way.

Five years later, he publishes a book ‚Äú1000 Days of Spring‚Äù and goes around giving lectures about what it means to live on the road. Find out more on his website: .

14,N4ZMYokojG,Cuba Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/explore/carib...

It‚Äôs only 93 miles from Florida, and just 13 from the Bahamas, but like the smoke that coils from its legendary cigars, The Republic of Cuba exists in a time and space all its own.
 
Few cities can stir the imagination like Cuba‚Äôs capital, Havana, a city preserved by forts, a five-mile seawall, and an imposed embargo, which held back the excesses of the 20th century for over 50 years.
  
Havana‚Äôs lure can be hard to resist, but Cuba offers so much more beyond the seductive lights of its capital. In Cuba, a long sandy beach is never far away. 
 
Just 12 miles from Havana‚Äôs downtown, the Eastern Beaches unroll toward the town of Matanzas, the birthplace of the rumba, and C√°rdenas, where the Cuban Flag flew for the very first time. From here, follow the scent of fresh lime, rum and suntan lotion north to Varadero. 
 
After exploring the northern coastline, turn south towards Cuba‚Äôs most revolutionary city, Santa Clara, and Trinidad, once the sugar capital of the world. Don‚Äôt miss elegant Cienfuegos, the only Cuban city founded by the French. 
 
Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to know whether Cuba is awakening to the world, or if the world is awakening to Cuba. Whatever your politics, it's easy to admire this island nation that has proudly gone its own way.
 
Cuba may still have one foot firmly in the past, but as the world tumbles towards tomorrow, we can be thankful for the many things it has not let go.",travel

Chicago, once a small trading post on Lake Michigan, has grown into one of the country‚Äôs most famous cities. Visit ‚ÄúThe Windy City‚Äù and chow down on deep dish pizza for a truly unique vacation experience.

Follow ‚ÄúThe Loop,‚Äù the city‚Äôs primary business district, and marvel at its array of high-rise buildings, consulates, and universities. Shopping and fine dining abound in this area. If you‚Äôve worn yourself out in the city proper, set a more sedate pace at the Riverwalk, a pedestrian path along the Chicago River, or visit the many museums and parks the city has to offer. You‚Äôll never believe you‚Äôre actually downtown when you walk through the Garfield Park Conservatory, and the Art Institute of Chicago will allow you to appreciate creative works from around the world.

No Chicago tour is complete without a mention of the nightlife, so close out your day at a jazz lounge and let the sweet sound of music carry you away. Visit our Chicago travel guide and plan your next vacation today.

The Bali Travel Guide serves as a guide and inspiration for people looking to travel to Bali for the first time. The Bali guide suggests sights to see, activities to do, or dishes to eat. It includes my top things to do and places to visit in Bali and is based on my travel to Bali during the summer of 2017. I spent roughly two weeks on the island visiting Ubud, the Gili Islands, and Seminyak. 

I tried to add as much helpful information as I could, which I hope provides a good idea on how to travel Bali or at least serve as a form of inspiration. If you have any suggestions or feedback feel free to comment below, as any feedback is appreciated, I hope you find the video useful. Don't forget to like and subscribe for more content!

20,JRaakIL-N_,Fiji Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Fiji.d6023598...

The locals in Fiji have a saying, ‚ÄúBulla,‚Äù which means ‚Äúlife‚Äù and ‚Äúgood health.‚Äù You‚Äôll hear it used frequently as a greeting when you arrive at the 330-strong islands that comprise this archipelago. You may even find yourself saying it before long!

Any Fiji tour will highlight its magnificent, unspoiled waters and lush landscapes. Go snorkeling, swimming, diving, and sailing on turquoise waters. If you‚Äôd rather stay on dry land, you can zipline through rainforests or explore the windy plains of the highland area. Travel to the interior and learn about traditional Fijian culture, or visit the capital city of Suva and wander through its colonial buildings, bazaars, and the quiet harbor. 

Two-thirds of the Fijian archipelago are uninhabited, and your Fiji sightseeing should include a stop at Denarau‚Äôs marina, where you can book a boat to take you to some of these pristine locations. From family-friendly islands to romantic getaways, you‚Äôll find something to your taste amongst these scattered isles.

Do you have a favorite memory of Fiji? Share it below!

21,LcKnx7I97yk,Dublin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Despite a long and sometimes tragic history of invasion and resistance, this thriving business capital has poetry, music and literature percolating through its cobblestones.

Dubliner, Oscar Wilde once said ‚Äúlife is too important to be taken seriously.‚Äù While Dublin proudly honours its past, it is equally passionate about enjoying each and every new day. Nowhere is life celebrated more than in the city‚Äôs nearly 700 pubs. Nothing matters more to Dubliners than having a good time or, as locals call it, the craic.

Of all the gifts, Dublin has given to the world, perhaps the most intoxicating are its stories. Originally built for the sons of the Irish gentry, the ivy-covered stone buildings of Trinity College are home to some of the oldest remaining manuscripts in the world, including the 1000-year-old Book of Kells.

Dubliner Jonathan Swift, once said, ‚ÄúMay you live all the days of your life.‚Äù There is no better way to define Dublin. Its passion for life is contagious, captivating and sure to stay with you for the rest of your days.

26,-VZpk_Pvr-A,Bulgaria Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Bulgaria.
Bulgaria is located in the extreme south east of Europe, a country of natural splendour, fairy-tale like villages, ancient ruins, and monasteries with remarkable frescos as well as a culture that is between both Orient and Occident. Sofia, the ‚Äòwise woman‚Äô and, since 1879, capital of the new Bulgaria, a city whose roots date back to the fifth century B.C.  Once Thracians settled, then followed Romans, Goths, Huns and Ottomans.  At the end of the nineteenth century the city‚Äôs appearance changed from Oriental to European into a dynamic metropolis. Sofia‚Äôs historic city centre features the most splendid sacred building in the Balkan Peninsula, the Aleksand√¢r Nevski Cathedral, a work of art of the Russian Orthodox religion that can accommodate a congregation of more than five thousand. Vidin is dominated by the Baba Vida Fortress whose impressive towers and bastion date back to the thirteenth century.  From the banks of the Danube the north western entrances to the mediaeval realm were strictly controlled and the fortress protected it from invasion by ship. Varna is the biggest city on the Black Sea coast and is one of Europe‚Äôs oldest cities.  The golden, shining domes of the impressive cathedral in the city centre are one of its main landmarks. The caves of western Rhodopes are the main destination for many of the region‚Äôs visitors, such as the Jagodina Cave that is ten kilometres long and extends up to five levels within the limestone mountains.  It is the longest and deepest of the Rhodopes and its tunnels and huge galleries feature traces of prehistoric inhabitants. Bulgaria ‚Äì on the border of both Occident and Orient - a country full of history and natural beauty with authentic culture and overwhelming hospitality.  A colourful mixture of fascinating tribes with a large variety of tradition and, according to legend, a part of paradise that God gifted to the Bulgarian people!

35,AlCqyZEXM1I,Travel More & Buy Less. | Luis Vargas | TEDxPortland,"We live in a world of consumption. Before you buy your next item for your ""man cave"" or ""she shed,"" think again. Adventure and exploration is the best way to learn and expand your horizons. The idea here is simple and enlightening, that one should have a passport full of stamps rather than a house full of stuff. Travel more. Buy less. 

With special thanks to the UNIVERSITY OF OREGON for presenting partnership, a world class stage design provided by HENRY V, an incredible legacy bound book provided by PREMIER and to the creative digital craft provided by ENJOY THE WEATHER. All of our Partners and event history can be found TEDxPortland.com 

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)

Luis was born in Mexico City, grew up in California and found home in Oregon. He has spent 20 years working around the World in the digital start-up and adventure travel space helping iconic brands like Disney, REI, and The Clymb create meaningful experiences-based businesses. His purpose is to inspire and enable others to have transformative travel experiences, with the knowledge that travel can be a force for good.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",travel

53,_EkO2ofPOXg,Jordan Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"Want to know what goes into creating one of the Expedia Vacation Travel Guide videos? Check out how we made Jordan here: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/video/...



The ancient Greeks knew Jordan‚Äôs capital, Amman, as Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Overlooking Amman is the Citadel, the city‚Äôs ancient core. Rising over the Citadel are the remaining pillars of the Temple of Hercules, a Roman temple that in its day dwarfed many in Ancient Rome.  

 

From Amman, journey north to Jerash, home to one of the largest concentrations of Roman ruins outside Italy. Then, continue north to Ajloun Castle, built to halt the Crusader armies as they rode down Jordan‚Äôs northern valley, hell-bent on Jerusalem.

 

Enter the gravel plains of the Eastern Desert and follow the Desert Castle Loop. For many, the highlight here is Qasr al-Azraq, where Lawrence of Arabia made his winter headquarters. 

 

Travel south to Madaba, famed for the Madaba Map, one of the earliest depictions of the Holy Lands. Continue south along the Kings Highway, which once took Arabs to Mecca, and Israelites to the Promised Land. 

 

Follow the hairpin road 1300 feet below sea level to the Dead Sea. Float in the saline waters and cover yourself in the same mineral-rich muds Cleopatra once enjoyed. 

 

No visit to Jordan is complete without a visit to Petra. Emerge from the shadows of the Siq and gaze up at the Treasury, the greatest of all of Petra‚Äôs 500 tombs. Then continue south to explore the emptiness of Wadi Rum. 

 

From epic landscapes to monumental ruins, Jordan allows us to reach out and touch the eternal, and be at one with something far greater than ourselves.",travel

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video:  and this one: 

Q How do you work together with brands?
A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: ",travel

70,DEJx0CYrDHk,Rome Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"As legend has it, Rome, Italy, was founded by the twin brothers, Romulus and Remus, in 700 B.C. The former Caput Mundi, or Capital of the World, sits beneath Palatine Hill, where the ruins of its original incarnation are open for exploration.

No Rome tour is complete without stopping by the remains of the Temple of Saturn and Arch of Septimus, both located in the Roman Forum. Get in touch with your inner gladiator and stop by the Colosseum, a relic of Roman bloodsports and perhaps the most recognizable element of the city.

Toss a coin into the Trevi Fountain to ensure you‚Äôll return to Rome one day; don‚Äôt toss in two coins unless you‚Äôre ready to fall in love with a Roman. Continue your Rome sightseeing in St. Peter‚Äôs Square, home of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica. The world‚Äôs largest church, designed by Michelangelo, is both a remarkable structure and a tribute to faith. You can look down from the famous dome to the Holy Square, which is usually filled with the faithful looking to obtain a blessing from the Pope. After this, it‚Äôs just a few steps to restaurants filled with Italian food. Forget coming back to Rome ‚Äì you‚Äôll never want to leave.

What‚Äôs your favorite memory of Rome?

74,ka-ZgwCXK,Venice Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Rising from the waters of Venice Lagoon is the Italian city of Venice, a city like no other.
Begin your visit in the central district of San Marco, and walk upon one of the world‚Äôs great squares, St Mark‚Äôs Square. The square is surrounded by some of the city‚Äôs finest jewels such as St Mark‚Äôs Basilica, St Mark‚Äôs Campanile and Doge‚Äôs Palace. 
 
Just outside stand the Columns of San Marco and San Teodoro. From here, journey along one of the world‚Äôs great aquatic thoroughfares, The Grand Canal. Glide past elegant palazzos; once the homes of wealthy merchants, today many of these palaces house important museums and galleries. 
 
Known as The City Of Bridges, Venice has hundreds to explore. The Accademia Bridge links the San Marco district to the Accademia Gallery, and offers some of the Grand Canal‚Äôs finest views. The oldest of the Grand Canal‚Äôs four crossings is the Rialto Bridge, which today still serves as the gateway to the Rialto Markets. The most famous of all is the Bridge of Sighs, which connects Doge‚Äôs Palace to the historic prison.
 
Venice is a city to get lost in, so put away your map and let her surprise you. Discover waterfront promenades of The Zattere and the sleepy canals and spacious piazzas of Castello. On the tiny island of Murano, glassmakers have been creating works of incredible delicacy and color for over 700 years. Further across the lagoon, the island of Burano is famed for its brightly colored houses and exquisite lace.
 
Venice has shone her light into the far corners of the world for over one and a half thousand years. Just remember, this city smiles upon those who linger. So stay for a few nights, or stay for a month, and savor every moment she has to offer.

76,2jS0Fd3WQVg,"NUUK - Travel in Nuuk, Greenland","Adventure, incredible hiking, fishing and boat rides - it doesn‚Äôt get much more picturesque than Greenland and nowhere more so than the capital city Nuuk.

If you loved our look at Nuuk, check out the site for more articles on Greenland -  - and make sure to SUBSCRIBE for tons of travel porn, including two more episodes in Southern Greenland - 

‚úà‚úà‚úà

Nuuk is the capital of Greenland, and with about 17,000 residents, it holds almost a quarter of the population of the whole country.

In this episode, Brianna and Macca discover what the city has to offer and go on some epic adventures just outside of it.

There is a lot going on in this big city with a small town feel, from nightlife to concerts and more and more restaurants popping up. 

Within minutes in any direction, you can find a gorgeous look out point.

We met up with Anna Nivika, a local food blogger who is really changing the way that Greenlanders use food.

We had to try some for ourselves, and got to experience a traditional Greenlandic BBQ on the beach at Inuk Hostels.

We went on two tours with Touring Greenland that blew us away. First, we visited the abandoned settlement of Kangeq and loved it so much that we planned another.

We went on the most incredible hike amongst mountains, streams and snow, ending up at the edge of a giant waterfall. We were met with a boat that picked us up and took us fishing for our dinner.

Once we had caught it, we visited a restaurant that cooked our fish for us, along with a plethora of other delicious treats.

We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling!

78,KtuTa8N3GZk,Alaska Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Alaska.
Alaska is a country situated on the edge of the Arctic and dream destination for wildlife and nature lovers who answer to the call of the wild.  A land of bears, glaciers, pioneers and prospectors on the northern tip of the American continent. In Vancouver, Canada‚Äôs pearl of the Pacific Ocean, begins an extraordinary journey along the Alexander Archipelago in the Gulf Of Alaska, a charming capital with European flair.  In English Bay a giant metal crab guards the planetarium and by aquabus our journey travels across False Creek to Science World with its marvellous glass globe that contains a museum of modern art. Ketchikan is a small town located five hundred and twenty six nautical miles north of Vancouver and was founded by the Tlingit Indians.  In the 1880‚Äôs the town based its economy on salmon and timber but today relies upon tourism. Since 1900, Juneau has been the capital city of Alaska, the forty ninth state of the U.S.A.  In 1880, Joe Juneau, Richard Harris and their Tlingit Indian leader, Chief Kowee, discovered gold in Gold Creek and the gold rush began. Glacier Bay was completely covered by ice and glaciers around four thousand years ago during the Little Ice Age.  The ice melted and the ever-changing glaciers are today situated within the arms of the bay which stretches almost a hundred kilometres to the north. Barrow is the northernmost point of inhabited North America and five hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle.  The living conditions in the arctic wastelands are extremely harsh and most of the year it is bone-chillingly cold. Even today the promise of untamed nature and boundless freedom attracts us to America‚Äôs final wilderness.  Alaska is full of wild extremes and stark contrasts, a fascinating land of pure adventure!

83,Em4lbLf09M0,How to Pack Clothes for Traveling üëïüíº,"When traveling it's important to pack efficiently, organized and smart. I show a method to roll your clothing into a tight bundle that makes it compact and easy to transport. Rolling your clothes is a great way to prevent wrinkles and conserve space. When you roll clothing you can fit more than you can normally by folding or just placing clothes into your luggage bag. This can also be used for things other than traveling such as any time you are moving clothing and want to conserve space. The same method can be used on other clothes that I did not demonstrate such a shorts. Which are rolled the same way the pants were rolled. Small items of clothing such as socks and underwear can be placed on top of a T-shirt and rolled up inside the shirt.

If you enjoy the channel, please support Von Malegowski:

The clothes rolling technique may seem like it takes longer than simply folding the clothes but if you do it more you will become more proficient and see that it really doesn't take much longer and produces better results. 

If you are worried about wrinkling your clothing you can unpack them when you reach your destination and they shouldn't have any wrinkles yet. If your clothes do have wrinkles I have a video about removing wrinkles from clothes without an iron üëï( which shows some easy methods of removing wrinkles.

Clothing Traveling Tips: Some simple tips to help you pick suitable clothing for traveling.

#1: When choosing your clothing for a trip, look at each item‚Äôs fabric and consider the following factors: quality, thickness, weight, wrinkles, transparency, and texture. Ideal travel clothing is durable, takes up minimal space and weight, is wrinkle-free, opaque, and matches with the rest of your clothing in style and fit.

#2: Be aware of your color palette when selecting clothing. If your color palettes are cross compatible, you will have many outfits from less clothing. 

#3: Most places you go will have much of what you need. You can buy almost anything, anywhere in the world. So you can get away with only packing half of what you think you‚Äôll need. 

#4: Versatile, low-maintenance clothing is important when packing light. Consider 5 factors that make an article of clothing desirable when traveling and aim to have each piece you bring satisfy at least 3 of them. 
- Comfortable for touring around, but can be dressed up for the evening 
- Is appropriate for cool or warm weather 
- Doesn‚Äôt show stains 
- Folds up small 
- Coordinates well with almost everything else you‚Äôre bringing 
By doing this you maximize the usage of each article of clothing so you can bring less. 

#5: If you‚Äôre traveling for longer than 7 days only pack enough clothes for 7 days, no matter how long you‚Äôre traveling for. It‚Äôs easier to find a Laundromat once a week then carry around the extra weight of more clothing than is necessary. 

#6: Avoid clothing that is too bulky and may take up too much space and Instead of bringing a bulky jacket, bring a light jacket and dress in layers.    

#7: A long sleeve and a short sleeve button shirt will work well for most places you travel to as well as some T-shirts.     

#8: Roll your clothing efficiently to allow for more space. Using the method I demonstrate can save a lot of space and allow you to pack lighter.

85,qvuv6bg9dgQ,OUR BIGGEST TRAVEL FAIL! | Day 4 | Vietnam Vlogs 2019,"When you‚Äôre young, it makes sense to go out on a limb and do something more adventurous when traveling abroad. You see the backpackers on Instagram living it up in Asia, travel bloggers living the nomad lifestyle, and it looks so fun, easy and exciting. When I imagined our trip to Ha Long I imagined all of that. 

We booked a homestay (AirBnB of Vietnam) for one night in Ha Long before our cruise in the bay the next day. I figured we had the accommodation set up. Now all we had to do was get there and start exploring. It‚Äôs 2019, this should be easy with smart phones and google maps and Grab (Uber of Vietnam). Ha. Umm. Well‚Ä¶ 

Let's just say the entire day was one big fail.

89,45ETZ1xvHS0,London Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/London.d178279...

A trip to London might as well be a trip through history. This city has long been a hub for finance, education, and culture, and is full of modern construction mixed with ancient buildings. 

Your London tour must include St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, one of its most well-known churches. You‚Äôll also want to see the Tower of London, the Palace of Westminster, and Westminster Abbey for exquisite examples of the city‚Äôs famous architectural landmarks. Walk or jog through numerous green spaces, among them Hyde Park and Green Park, in the center of London.

Continue your London sightseeing in the West End, where you‚Äôll find ancient buildings converted into modern shops, restaurants, bars, and shows. You‚Äôll find one of the largest theatre districts in the world here, and can take in a different play almost every night of the week. 

For a real treat, climb aboard the London Eye, a giant, rotating Ferris wheel, and see the old and new parts of the city all at once.

After arriving in Moscow for Jess birthday she decided that she wanted to go inside a Russian bunker...so we went to the Cold War Museum aka Bunker 42 where went 68 meters below ground and learnt more about this soviet bunker.

To celebrate her birthday we went out to have dinner (and a Moscow mule) at Razvedka (–†–∞–∑–≤–µ–¥–∫–∞).

104,1PGiixdhNVk,Portland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Portland.d1782...

Welcome to Portland, Oregon, where you can experience the laid-back atmosphere of the Pacific Northwest amid beautiful natural surroundings.

A Portland tour is easily accomplished on foot; this city was designed for pedestrians, so you‚Äôll be able to get around quickly. As you stroll along, you‚Äôll find plenty of parks, fountains, and buildings old and new to explore. Be warned, this city is known for its sudden showers, so make sure you bring an umbrella to shield yourself until the sun makes a triumphant return.

If you like a good brew, you‚Äôre going to love Portland‚Äôs alter-ego, Beervana ‚Äì so named thanks to all the breweries located here. Wine snobs, don‚Äôt despair; you‚Äôll find plenty to drink (responsibly) in the Willamette Valley while you continue your Portland sightseeing. 

If you‚Äôre here with the kids ‚Äì or you just really love animals ‚Äì don‚Äôt forget to stop by the Oregon Zoo, home to eagles, bobcats, and a ton of other feathered, furry, and scaled critters. Travelers with children will also love the Portland Children‚Äôs Museum, where the little ones can learn from and play with interactive exhibits. 

Whether you‚Äôre here for the beautiful views or to responsibly sample the vintages in the valley, Portland has something for everyone. What are you going to do when you get there?

Don‚Äôt know where to hide your saved money while traveling? Whatever your travel destination may be, you should know where to hide your money to avoid risks.

108,SlR0Y1dGecE,Dubai Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
Dubai is a fairy-tale holiday paradise with romantic desert scenery and a long history. Like an ancient kingdom from the 'One Thousand And One Nights', it's the second largest state in the United Arab Emirates located on the northern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. The trading of dates, goats, pearls and fish brought the city much prosperity and it gradually developed into the largest trading centre in the Near East.

Maritime life has always played a significant role in the lives of those who live on the Arabian Gulf. With its triangular sails and a design that has remained unchanged for thousands of years, the dhow still sails these waters. Hundreds of them lie at anchor close to the old town on the banks of Dubai Creek.

No other city in the United Arab Emirates possesses so many fascinating contrasts. But the past is gradually merging with the present and portrays a new and harmonious image. Dubai's impressive silhouette is in stark contrast to the desert sand and sparkling sea.

The Deira district owes its prosperity to the various souks that were established there in the 19th century. At this time, Dubai was already an important trading city with almost 7,000 inhabitants. The number of stalls in the souk rose to more than 300 and a modest tax was imposed for the coffers of the local Sheikh.

Amid the desert surroundings, in front of the city gates, is the Nad Al Sheba Camel Course where the intrepid creatures of the desert are trained during the winter months and where the jockeys are young boys from Somalia and Pakistan.

Dusty gravel roads lead into the Hajar Mountains, part of the splendid mountain landscape in the eastern section of the Emirates.

Dubai's skyline has a new landmark, the Burj Al Arab, the only hotel in the world to have been awarded no less than seven stars! Built on a man-made island, its design is that of a sail bent by the wind.

Dubai, the height of luxury amid the desert sand is a glittering fairytale of the 21st century.

Things everyone does on snapchat they don't want to admit!
First, everyone uses filters when they aren't looking their best. Whether you just woke up or are having a bad hair day, snapchat filters will cover it all! Next, we've all looked into getting surgery to look like that snapchat dog right...? oh just me? Just kidding, I really hope no one has done that. Third, we've all redone a ""candid looking"" snapchat because we didn't like the angle, how our hair looked, etc.

Here‚Äôs a glimpse into her picturesque journey through the woods and about her choice of taking the road less travelled. There‚Äôs magic somewhere in a far away land. Every millennial traveler outlives that. There‚Äôs always a less you bring back home after a trip. There‚Äôs a part of you that you leave behind when you leave a place. Being a woman, it takes something just more than a dream to go out and explore the world the way you want it to be. Here‚Äôs presenting you someone who‚Äôs broken all such norms.

Shramona Poddar, a 25 year old, likes to identify herself as a part-time traveller and a full-time dreamer, she spends most of her time eating, doodling, travelling, dreaming and storytelling. She strongly believes in living in the moment and wishes to travel as much as she can ‚Äòbecause you never know when one might die‚Äô, says the young traveller. A dog and kid lover, she still finds it tough in deciding what she loves more, the mountains or the sea?

My Millennial Life Crisis was started 3 years ago when I was stuck in a rut creatively, career wise, and personally. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I wasn't happy with where I was living, and I didn't feel like I had much of a support system. That is how the Millennial Life Crisis series was born. It was a way for me to let go of my feelings and document my personal growth. Along the way I have found that a lot of you have related with this feeling, that is why I keep vlogging. From now on you can expect weekly Millennial Life Crisis episodes about my life, growing up, career growth, trying new things, friendships, relationships, family, and travels.",travel
123,N3ISUUO0CS,St. Petersburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Four hundred miles west of Moscow is St. Petersburg, Russia. A striking city resting on the banks of the Neva River, St. Petersburg has long been a draw for lovers of architecture, as St. Petersburg tours often begin with the city's legendary structures.

Enter a world of towering cathedrals, palaces, and gardens, many of them set down by the order of Peter the Great in the 18th century. As the decades passed, later members of Russian royalty added to the city's opulence by constructing additional marvels. Walk through the Palace Square, located in the heart of St. Petersburg and home of the Winter Palace, the sprawling home of Catherine the Great. Next, pay a visit to St. Isaac's Cathedral and its gold-plated dome, which glitters in the sunshine. If you walk to the top of its dome, you will be rewarded with astonishing views of the city.

Continue your St. Petersburg sightseeing by taking a boat ride down the river to Peterhof Gardens & Palace. This gilded structure and its lush array of plant life was constructed to rival France's Palace of Versailles, and is a popular place for a quiet walk in nature or to reflect upon the engineering marvel of its 60 fountains, all of which flow continuously without the use of pumps. 

Spend your evening walking along Nevsky Prospect, St. Petersburg's main thoroughfare. Besides offering even more beautiful architecture to gaze upon, Nevsky Prospect is loaded with restaurants and boutiques. Enjoy a delicious meal, shop around for the perfect Russian souvenir, and plan the itinerary for your next day in this magnificent city.

When ready, check out vacation packages to Los Cabos: 



A tale of two towns on the very edge of Baja California Sur, Los Cabos is synonymous with relaxation and recreation. But when the team at Expedia made the voyage here, they found more than just a beautiful vacation destination.
They uncovered new shores, geological monuments, and exciting experiences. They encountered a region with diverse and welcoming people, vibrant art culture, world-class cuisine, and of course, a thrilling nightlife. 

For a romantic secluded escape, consider the arty San Jose del Cabo, a cultural hub bursting with inspiring art, Spanish colonial architecture and sheltered shores. 

If you are chasing the fiesta, check in to a hotel in Cabo San Lucas. Every sunset brings a new party to the sands and the streets here, so don‚Äôt forget to pack your dancing shoes.

126,S-hFKC_RKI,Tokyo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Tokyo.d179900...

Welcome to Tokyo, the capital of Japan and the epitome of the word ‚Äúmegacity.‚Äù

In this vast metropolis, ancient traditions blend with futuristic buildings, and your Tokyo sightseeing will take you to representations of each. Pay your respects at temples set in forested hillsides, then flex your credit card in one of the shopping districts, before sitting down to a five-star meal‚Ä¶all in one day.

Your Tokyo tour begins with the subway and train system, which will take you all over this sprawling city. Tokyo is home to some 35 million people, many of which you‚Äôll meet as its public transit carries you throughout its many neighborhoods. Make a stop in Asakusa, a temple district nestled in leafy trees with skyscrapers towering in the background. There you‚Äôll visit Nakamisi Dori, a street loaded with food vendors and religious charms. Get to know the city a little better in the Harajuku district, home to cutting-edge fashion, a thriving, youth-centered culture, and the famous Yoyogi Park. The park stands out in stern contrast to the rest of the neighborhood; this sprawling, 134-acre green space is where locals slow down after a frenzied week of work and play.

 As night falls, make your way to Shinjuku. Many of Tokyo‚Äôs premier restaurants and pubs span Shinjuku‚Äôs streets, and you can indulge in succulent 5-star meals or sample with fast food from local vendors. Watch a movie, do some karaoke, and linger with fellow travelers and friendly locals alike.

What was your favorite part of Tokyo?

This lake-side city provides the pulse that keeps this remote corner of the world energetic and youthful. As the descendants of fierce Polynesian warriors and determined European settlers, the Kiwis have the spirit of adventure running though their veins. 

Experience the beauty of Lake Wakatipu aboard the TSS Earnslaw. Nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Lady of the Lake‚Äù, for over 100 years this steamship hasn‚Äôt missed a beat, transporting livestock and passengers to and from the High Country. Back in Queenstown, soak up the Aotearoa sunshine on a sandy beach or in Queenstown Gardens. For a bird‚Äôs-eye view, ride the Skyline gondola to Bob‚Äôs Peak. Then when the sun gets low, head to Marine Parade and enjoy Mother Nature‚Äôs spectacle with kindred spirits from all over the world. 

Queenstown expands and contracts with the rhythm of the seasons. After the hectic summer, the town transforms into a world-class ski destination. Queenstown has three main ski fields; The Remarkables Ski Field, Cardrona Alpine Resort and the Coronet Peak Ski Area.

When the snow melts, Queenstown transforms again to accommodate visitors who flock to the Arrow Basin to explore its charming historic towns. The Kiwis know when it‚Äôs time to slow down, unwind and enjoy the finer things in life. Queenstown and the nearby Gibbston Valley are home to over 75 wineries, where vintners produce pinot noirs acclaimed for their purity, freshness and vitality, a perfect reflection of the region itself!",travel
128,iXGtx-hroKE,Working online and traveling the world - digital nomads | DW Documentary,"Working online whilst traveling the world sounds like a dream job for many people. But what exactly is a digital nomad? Pete and Supi live as digital nomads.

They travel the world permanently, work on the road and are always online. Their lives epitomize the digital revolution and how it is changing how we work live.

Many people dream of living and working on the road - a dream that has come true for Pete and Supi. Driven by a passion for travel, they set out to escape the dreary routine of everyday life. They want to achieve maximum self-fulfilment without big safety nets and full-cover insurance, in a nomadic world of adventure. Pete is a DJ, so parties and big cities are a defining part of his life, whereas Suparni aka Supi is the opposite; she‚Äôs looking for spirituality and awareness. The two show us the huge spectrum of opportunities that the world of the digital nomad has to offer. Despite their fundamental differences, they both earn their living by working remotely. The digital age has made this way of life possible: without the Internet, it would be almost unthinkable. But their lifestyle does have its limits, as is becoming especially evident to Suparni with her plans for parenthood. But it's hard to find someone you love who also loves the same sort of lifestyle, and the constant travel is a big obstacle.

133,dkE1QX523PE,Latvia Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Latvia.
Latvia is a small Baltic republic, a country with a strong national identity, situated within the centre of the Baltic States.  Throughout the course of history its desire for freedom has always taken it forward. Riga is the capital of Latvia, a Hanseatic city and European capital of culture. Saint Petri Church is one of the oldest in the centre of the city and, at the same time, a main landmark.  It is one of the most important sacred buildings of the Middle Ages and is closely linked with the development of the city. Close to Riga is Jurmala, today a popular health resort on the Latvian Riviera, with splendid bay-windowed villas, battlements and towers, formerly Baroque and later with a nod at Gothic.  Thirty kilometres of beaches with bright erinaceous quartz and a mild climate created a holiday paradise in the nineteenth century. Amid the fertile Zemgale Plain is the magnificent, huge Baroque Jelgava Castle, the largest in Latvia.  In 1737 the residence of the then secular ruler of the Duchy Of Kurland was built on the ramparts of an ancient castle of the Livonian Order.  Beneath the southeast corner of the castle is the Crypt Of The Dukes, a tomb vault with thirty superbly decorated sarcophagi of tin and wood. The picturesque primordial river valley of Gauja has for centuries attracted travellers from each corner of the world.  This Livonian Switzerland not only has the charm of primary nature, but also all the ambience of the Middle Ages. Today‚Äôs Latvia is now striking a healthy balance between a market economy, ancient traditions and the burdensome legacy of a turbulent past.   Its journey into the European Union has been a success, thanks to courage, strength and faith!

What You Shouldn't Do When You Are in Italy 
Visiting Italy is an amazing experience whether you are seeing the Roman ruins throughout the country in places like Rome or Naples, but for all the amazing things you should do in Italy (visit Venice, Florence, Rome, Ravenna, Amalfi Coast, eat until you explode) there are things you DON'T DO when you come to Italy & Here are our 12 things NOT TO DO in Italy when you are traveling Italy. 
Filmed in Vicenza, Italy
Copyright Mark Wolters 2016

The Don'ts of Italy
1. Don't expect to get discount prices on fancy Italian luxury brands. 

2. Don't eat near tourist sights. You will be ripped off and not get as good of Italian food as you would away from the tourist sights. 
 
3. Don't Tip. They already charge you for service. 
4. You Don't have to scream louder to get people to understand you. 
5. Don't worry about overdressing, the Italians will always look better than you.
6. Don't just visit Rome and Venice, there is so much more to Italy. 
7. Don't share your pizza and make sure you do eat it with your fork and knife.
8. Don't use the fast trains for short distances, they are not worth the significantly higher prices. 
9. Don't expect to see spaghetti and meatballs on the menu TOGETHER. They will be there separately, but not together. 
10. Don't expect a big breakfast in Italy. Just coffee and a cookie. 
11. Don't overpack. You will be limited on space when traveling in Italy so pack accordingly. 
12. Don't expect to be served food in a restaurant between 3pm and 7pm.

Travel video about destination India.
India is a subcontinent with a long history, a land of legend, fantasy and reality.A country that extends from the Himalayas in the north to the semi-desert terrain and tropics of the south. A place of incredible contrasts and fascinating splendour. Delhi is the political and administrative capital of India and a melting pot of both culture and religion. A constantly expanding metropolis built on the site of twelve former cities and centre of power for almost a thousand years. Jama Masjid, the Friday Mosque, is one of ancient Delhi‚Äôs main landmarks that was bequeathed to the city by the mogul king, Shah Jahan and close to the mosque is the bazaar district of Chandni Chowk, a busy commercial area. The white temples of Ranakpur are the sanctuaries of the Jains and are situated in a picturesque valley to the west of the Aravalli Mountains north of Udaipur. At around the same time that Buddhism was introduced to the area, Jainism also arrived, the religion of the country‚Äôs great hero, Mahavira. Rajasthan is the Land Of The Maharajas in all its splendour, a living fairytale beneath the desert sky. Agra was once the imposing metropolis of the mogul monarchy and today the city has lost nothing of its mediaeval atmosphere. Calcutta, or Kolkata, as it has been known since 2001, is the capital of West Bengal and also the second largest city in India. A city of contrasts that could not be more striking. Each morning hundreds of people go to the Howrah Bridge to bathe on the banks of the Hooghly River, a tributary of the sacred River Ganges. In 1853 Bombay had its first railroad and the Indian rail network was soon extended. The Victoria Terminus was built, one of the most impressive train stations in the world. Incredible India, a remarkable country that has always fascinated travellers by the amazing diversity of its people, culture and landscapes.

141,A-63Yawo0zI,Learn English - Travel Vocabulary,"http://www.engvid.com/ Learn important, basic words you will need when you travel. Knowing a little English vocabulary can help a lot when you are travelling. Whever you are going in the world, you can almost always find someone who speaks some English. I'll teach you how a ""tourist attraction"" is different from a ""tourist trap"". What about ""sight seeing""? Do you know what an ""itinerary"" is? Do you have your travel documents? Get ready for your English to take flight! 

Hi. James, from EngVid. I was just about to plan my vacation. I'm going to take a long flight to Europe. I'm trying to remember luggage and baggage things, you know? It's kind of hard to do. But this is a lesson for you if you've been working a lot, you need some time off. Now, there's a video I would like you to go check out. That's on time off. It goes with this one. You might want to go away somewhere and not just stay home, right? So this video is for you. This is basic vocabulary on vacation. When you leave and maybe you go to an English speaking country and you want to practice your English, this stuff will be good for you to enjoy your time there, also to make it easy for you when you arrive. Are you ready? Let's go to the board.

Mr. E, Mr. E! It's a mystery where he is. It's no mystery. And you thought I forgot. Mr. E has been on vacation with me, and he's enjoying this particular attraction. So let's go to the board.

Now, if you're going to go on vacation, one of the first things you will have to do if you're leaving your country is you're going to need some travel documents. What are those? Documents. A ""document"" is a paper or something with information that tells you something is okay or outlines it for you. For example, your passport is a document given by the government with your picture on it that says you are a citizen of this country, and you are legal. You are a good person. Okay? Now, when you're leaving for a flight, or you want to go to another country, you're going to need travel documents first. Trust me; show up at the airport and go, ""I leave now. I go to Canada."" They will go, ""And the car is that way. Go home, crazy man. Okay?"" So we need travel documents. So what are ""travel documents""? Well, ""travel documents"" would be your passport, government identification, usually needed at most places the travel. Inside of a country, not necessary for most places. But leaving the country, you have to have it. Okay? So if you're in the European Union, no problem. If you're in Canada and the United States, you don't need one. But as soon as you leave these countries, you need a passport.

What's another thing you need? Well, you need what's called a ""boarding pass"". If you play soccer, you kick the ball; the other guy, he catches it; you ""pass"" right? The ball goes from one player to another. A ""boarding pass"" is what allows you to go from one country to another country. You show the person on the airplane this piece of paper with your passport, and they say, ""You know what? You can come on the plane and fly, like the pass."" Kick, catch, other country. Cool? All right. So these are your travel documents. You need those.

Now, I should have started with you need to make a plan because you want to go visit some place. You want to go on vacation, right? And if you want to go on vacation, well, going to have to -- I said ""vacation"". A ""vacation"" is a holiday, another word for saying ""time off from work"". All right? So you want to go on vacation. Sometimes, we say, ""We're going to vacation in Italy."" Or ""on my vacation, I want to visit Italy."" Or ""I'm taking a holiday in Italy."" Okay? So all these words, when people say, ""Well, what are you doing on your time off?"" You might go, ""I'm going on vacation."" Then they know you're leaving. If you just say, ""I'm taking time off from work"", you could be home cleaning. But no. You're saying, ""I'm going on vacation."" They're going to go, ""Where are you going to visit? Italy, perhaps? Sicily? Is it going to be a good holiday?"" And you go, ""Yes. I earned my time."" ""Earned"" means to work for something. ""I earned my time off. I'm going on vacation.""",travel

144,8TJdP1Uf9x8,Japan: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar 2/5,"Japan: The Ultimate Travel Guide by TourRadar gives you all the info you need to explore the land of the rising sun. Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
Japan remains one of the most intensely fascinating places in the world, effortlessly intertwining modernity and tradition. Seek serenity in Kyoto by visiting one of thousands of temples spread throughout this former capital, or go skiing in Niseko or summit Mt. Fuji. Of course you can also kick back in one of the country‚Äôs many hot springs, where the rich mountain minerals will leave your skin feeling brand new. Once you‚Äôve achieved maximum relaxation, hit up Tokyo‚Äôs bustling night life or go hiking in Kamakura. 

What Japan lacks in square footage it makes up for in endless options for your itinerary. In this case, size definitely doesn‚Äôt matter! Consider booking a tour that allows you to see all of the country‚Äôs unique highlights, without missing the subtleties you can enjoy as a backpacker: 

Remember to pack clothes appropriate for the region you‚Äôre visiting, and if you‚Äôre planning on travelling from the North to the South outside of summer months, make sure you bring everything from flip-flops to snow boots. 

Japan‚Äôs currency is the Japanese Yen. Credit card and debit transactions aren‚Äôt common, so be sure to bring plenty of cash with you no matter where you travel within the country. Dining out doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive if you visit the right restaurants, and you can often enjoy a pre-fix menu for lunch for a very reasonable cost. Be sure to sample the Japanese whiskeys, as Japan is an expert whiskey distiller! 

‚Äî About Japan ‚Äî

With a population of nearly 130 million, this island nation is resides in the Pacific Ocean and has everything from dense cities to mountainous national parks. You‚Äôll discover that there‚Äôs countless reasons to move Japan up to the #1 spot on your bucket list. Sixty-six percent of the country is covered by trees and the Japanese enjoy the highest life expectancy in the world at 83.7 years.

145,EFQuYOU,Hong Kong Travel Tips: 11 Things to Know Before You Go,"11 things YOU need to know before you go to Hong Kong. A comprehensive travel guide to bring you up to speed on the Weather, Language, Getting Around, and more! Hong Kong was originally a British Colony founded in 1842, taken over by China in 1997. Hong Kong‚Äôs Official Name is the ‚ÄúSpecial Administrative Region of Hong Kong.‚Äù In Chinese Hong Kong Means ‚ÄúFragrant Harbor.‚Äù Hong Kong is Famous for Skyscrapers (it has 8,000 of them), but 40% of it‚Äôs land is park and nature preserve
Hong Kong has 3 main areas, Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories
But in total it has 263 islands

2 - Weather
Hong Kong's climate is sub-tropical, with temperatures dropping below 10 degrees Celsius in winter and exceeding 31 degrees Celsius in summer
Pretty humid all year round
May to November is typhoon season
June & August are the wettest
January and December are the dryest

3. Getting In
Likely flying in to Hong Kong International Airport - HKG.
 
It‚Äôs on Lantau Island, and its HUGE!  The size of 20 soccer fields.
 
You can fly to almost anywhere in the world from Hong Kong (more than 100 airlines operate 1,100 daily flights to and from 190 destinations worldwide) 
 
Cathay Pacific is Hong Kong‚Äôs home airline and has won ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Best Airline‚Äù four times ‚Äì more than any other.

Airport Express train to Central - Its just 24 minutes, and leaves every 10 minutes
You can buy a round trip airport Express and Octopus card for 3 days unlimited MTR for $350

Taxi one way to Hong Kong Island would be about $400 HKD and take 45 mins to an hour

4. Unlucky
This number omitted because it‚Äôs unlucky.  4 in Chinese sounds like the word for ‚ÄúDeath.‚Äù  Most buildings typically omit this floor.


5. Getting Around
By public transit‚Äîit's efficient, clean, and affordable
First things first, buy an Octopus Card -- It works on almost everything, even to get you in to the Hong Kong Horse Racetrack
MTT - Subway
Star Ferry - About $3 HKD, Upper Deck & Weekends cost a bit more.
Tram - Ding Ding - $2.60
Double Decker Bus
Mini Bus
Taxi - Relatively inexpensive, but can be hard to hail during rush hour, or a rainy day, or shift change between 3-4pm.
Don‚Äôt try to hail a cab if you see double yellow lines by the curb. Taxis can only stop if there is a single line‚Äîor none at all.
Uber


6. Money
Hong Kong Dollar
Exchange Rate fixed to the USD.  1 USD = HK$7.75‚Äì7.85
Most places take Visa/Mastercard
40% take AMEX
Lots of ATMS -- Hong Kong is a huge financial center after all
Bills: Issued by 3 different banks, so you‚Äôll see 3 different designs for all the bills
HK$20, HK$50, HK$100, HK$500 and HK$1000
Coins: 


7. Language
2 Official Languages
1.Chinese, (Spoken Cantonese)
2. English
 
In the major urban districts, most residents will speak English but Cantonese is the local language
 
If you think you‚Äôre planning to learn a little Cantonese before you go‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not easy‚Ä¶ it has nine tones.

8. Shopping

Shops often stay open late‚Ä¶ none of this European 6pm closing time‚Ä¶ think 9 or 10pm closing times for most shops and malls

9. Food:

Cantonese Food
And it‚Äôs all about sharing, portions are big and made for big groups
Dim sum originated here in southern China and means ‚Äútouch the heart‚Äù. These tiny bites of goodness were created as snack food for travellers and today are an essential part of local culture.
Dim Sum
Hong Kong Milk Tea

Dai Pai Dong, Fast Food Noodle Shops, are common sites in Hong Kong offering an inexpensive bowl of noodles for around HK$20 and free tea

 Bones -- yes, lots of the local food has bones it.  At the casual restaurants you can just put the bones on the table.  At a fancier restaurant use the saucer plate beneath your bowl

Tea -- Need a refill for your teapot?  Turn the lid upside down.

Like to avoid the crowds?  Then avoid eating lunch between 1-2pm, that‚Äôs the typical Hong Kong lunch hour

10. Feng Shui
The mystical art of feng shui is still common practice in Hong Kong -- wondering why a building‚Äôs architecture looks weird?  The answer usually has to do with Feng Shui‚Ä¶ that might be why your hotel lobby has a water feature and some goldfish in it too!

Ready for an adventure? Click play on our travel guide video to uncover some of the best things to do in Syndey, Australia. 

Established in 1788 as a penal colony, Sydney was once a little rough around the edges, but it has since transformed into a must-visit coastal destination. Today, tourists flock to this city on the east coast of Australia for its pristine beaches, coves, and harbors. 

During your romp around the scenic coastline, make a stop at the Syndey Opera House and eye its magnificent architectural design. Looking for a little more adventure? Venture over to the Syndey Harbour Bridge, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Coathanger,‚Äù and brave a bridge climb tour. Next, hop on the antique thrill rides at Luna Park, which is a family-friendly favorite that dates back to 1935, or saunter around Darling Harbour. Meanwhile, if you‚Äôd prefer to make a splash, dive into the waves at Bondi Beach or hang ten at nearby Manly Beach. 

Dabble in the city‚Äôs history, architecture, and beach towns, and embark on several Sydney tours during your next trip to the capital of New South Walves. To jump-start your adventure and get more tips and ideas on how to spend your Sydney sojourn, check out our travel guide video.

149,JafY92PhgKU,Can We Travel Faster Than Light? with Dr. Miguel Alcubierre,"Can humanity build an Alcubierre warp drive? 
Can we go faster than light? 

Dr. Miguel Alcubierre was inspired by Star Trek the Next Generation's example of warp drive faster than light technology on the starship Enterprise. In 1994 he wrote a paper on how we could bend and warp space and time to travel faster than light within the rules of Einstein's general relativity. NASA has and is currently exploring if it is possible to bend the fabric of space and achieve hyper fast space travel with the Eagle Works lab. John Michael Godier spoke with Dr. Miguel Alcubierre on the feasibility of the Alcubierre warp drive and if there has been any developments within physics, including the use of dark matter or dark energy, and anti-gravity, to be able to make this possible.

154,jeI3Ni7m46g,China Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination China.
China‚Äôs Imperial City is located in the centre of its ancient Middle Kingdom, a gigantic and inscrutable empire beyond the Great Wall. The Imperial City is entered through the Gates of Heavenly Peace.After seven years of construction, Ming Emperor Zhu Di moved into his newly-established palace complex in which over eight thousand people lived in almost a thousand rooms. The palace served as both a residential and governmental seat to the emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. A stone‚Äôs throw away from the old Summer Palace is the Garden of Harmonious Unity that was the favourite garden of the Emperor‚Äôs household who retreated to its cool lakeside shores during the humid months of summer. Close to Badaling the Great Wall Of China extends majestically across misty mountains. It is the largest Man-made structure in the world and was erected to protect the country from invasion from the North. The gigantic wall represented the division of two very different cultures. On one side the Central Asian Nomads and on the other the highly developed civilisation of the emerging Chinese Empire. Shanghai is a Gigantic City and a meeting point of both east and west. The shoreline is without a doubt the city‚Äôs main focal point and is a combination of past, present and future and contains the historic monuments and eye catching buildings of a great city. Famous explorer Marco Polo referred to Suzhou as the ‚ÄòVenice of the East‚Äô, a city that is particularly famous for its gardens. Many of its extremely elegant buildings are remnants of a glorious past. Yunnan¬¥s most famous site is the unique Stone Forest Of Shi Lin, a forest of rock that extends for 27,000 hectares. Hong Kong is a city of the superlative with glimmering skyscrapers that seem to take root in the sky and one elegant building after another with shining glass and hi-tech facades. China is a world within a world!

There is a lot of conflicting information out there on the different websites for the dimensions of the suitcases. We wanted swivel wheels as well as the biggest carry-on that the airlines would allow. For each of the carryon suite cases, we examine the size, pockets, webbing, and handle.

Almost all airlines in 2018 state that the maximum carry-on suitcase dimensions are 9"" x 14"" x 22"". Two of these options actually measure larger, but we took them to the airport and tried them in the American Airlines, Allegiant Air, and United Airlines sizer bins to test them out.

159,IguTMV4LfK4,Canada From Coast To Coast Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Traveling with the train through entire Canada.
Halifax is the capital of the province of Nova Scotia and the oldest British settlement in Canada.  One of the most impressive ways to explore Canada is to travel by train.   The journey across the second largest country in the world begins at the train station close to Halifax Harbour and travels from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast covering thousands of miles.  The trains of today‚Äôs Via Rail are both comfortable and nostalgic and their elevated panoramic windows provide an excellent view of Canada‚Äôs remarkable scenery. Quebec was founded in 1608 by famous explorer Samuel De Champlain but  the city‚Äôs most well known and prominent landmark is the 19th century Chateau Frontenac Hotel, the traditional stopover hotel of the Canadian Pacific Railway that offers first class service plus a lavish and historical ambience. Qu√©bec‚Äôs historic buildings, various gates, city walls and old houses that date back to the18th and 19th centuries are still in remarkably good condition.  Up until the late 18th century the city was a French possession but following several decades of hostilities the British finally conquered the city. In Montr√©al the architecture of bygone times blends in with the modern skyscrapers of today. Around three million people live in Canada‚Äôs second largest city, the biggest French-speaking metropolis outside France.

161,9J4a37-h9Y8,Long Island Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/Long-Island.d...

Long Island stretches eastward for 115 miles, from the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens to the bluffs of Montauk Point.
 
Take the short train ride from Manhattan to the sands of Long Beach, which for many is where Long Island begins. From here, Long Island‚Äôs protective barrier islands continue all the way to Westhampton Island. Halfway along the chain, visit Fire Island Lighthouse, which for generations of immigrants was their first glimpse of America.
 
Many of those immigrants went on to create vast financial empires, and it was on Long Island‚Äôs northern shores where they built the mansions that would inspire F. Scott Fitzgerald‚Äôs classic, The Great Gatsby.
 
At the Cradle of Aviation Museum in nearby Hempstead, discover how Long Island launched generations of aviators into the wild blue yonder. Nearby, continue your flight into the past at the American Airpower Museum.
 
In the mid 1800s, well-to-do New Yorkers were drawn to the unspoiled beaches of Long Island‚Äôs East End. Today, the pioneer settlement of Southampton Village is a place where history and style have blended as smoothly as the spirits in a Long Island Iced Tea. The past been also been beautifully preserved in nearby Sag Harbor, a historic whaling port immortalized in Moby Dick.
 
Just a 30-minute drive east from Sag Harbor is Montauk, a place locals refer to as ‚ÄúThe End‚Äù. America‚Äôs first president, George Washington, commissioned Montauk Lighthouse on Long Island‚Äôs easternmost point. Climb to the top to take in the sweeping views of this place that has played center stage in some of America‚Äôs greatest stories.",travel

171,AQ6GmpMu5L8,Paris Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Paris.d179898....

Paris, the capital of France, attracts 42 million visitors a year. 

You can start your Paris tour on the metro, on foot, or with a taxi or bicycle; the city is easily navigable on all fronts. Visit the Arc de Triomphe in the center of the city and marvel at its graceful lines and commanding presence. Built between 1806 and 1836, the Arc is one of a number of historical arches and landmarks peppering Paris.

If your Paris sightseeing includes purchasing souvenirs, head to the Champs-√âlys√©es, home of boutique shopping, numerous restaurants, and many bars, along with a theatre and other entertaining venues. Learn about culture and creativity at the Louvre, a 14th-century palace turned art museum, and check in on the Mona Lisa and her mysterious smile. Notre Dame Cathedral cannot be missed, as this imposing Gothic structure has stood since 1345.

Speaking of imposing, the Eiffel Tower is most frequently used to represent Paris. Stroll beneath it to get a good idea of its height, or travel to the top for a stunning view of the City of Light.

TAKE THE QUIZ: 

TRANSCRIPT

Hello. My name is Emma, and in today's video I'm going to talk about something I love, and that is travel. So, if you like travelling too, if you're planning on going on a vacation, or if you know somebody who's travelling, this video will be very, very helpful to you. In this video I'm going to teach you some very important verbs. They're all phrasal verbs, and I'll explain what a phrasal verb is in a moment. So, these are all verbs that we use when we're talking about travel. Okay.

So, to get started, I wanted to tell you a little bit about phrasal verbs. What is a phrasal verb? One of the difficulties students have with English are verbs where you have a verb and a preposition. So, when you see a verb and a preposition together, that's a phrasal verb. Now, you might be thinking: ""What's a preposition?"" Good question. I'm going to give you an example. We have here four words, each of these is a phrasal verb. They all have the verb ""get"": ""get in"", ""get up"", ""get on"", ""get over"", and there's many more, ""get away"". There's tons of them. Each of these actually can have multiple meanings, too. So, one of the most difficult parts about English is learning phrasal verbs, because this, the blue part is the preposition, it can change the meaning of the verb. Okay? So, prepositions are words like: ""on"", ""off"", ""up"", ""down"", ""toward"", ""over"", ""away"", these types of words are prepositions. So, you'll notice with phrasal verbs, they're very, very common in conversation. They're... You can write them down, too, but in general, when people talk they often use phrasal verbs. Okay? So, they're very, very important, especially when you're talking about going on a trip with your friends or family.

So let's look at some of the common phrasal verbs we use when we're talking about trips. The first verb I want to teach you: ""Drop off"". Okay? So: ""drop"" is the verb, ""off"" is the preposition, together: ""drop off"" is a phrasal verb. What does this mean: ""drop off""? When you ""drop someone off"" it means you're taking them to a place and then you leave them there. So, for example, maybe your friend needs to go to the airport, so you drive them to the airport and you drop them off at the airport. This means you take them there and you leave them in that place. Okay? So they don't come home with you; they stay there. So, for example, I have a friend named Frank, and when Frank goes travelling: ""We drop Frank off at the airport."" So, we drive Frank to the airport, he has all his luggage, his suitcases, and then we say to Frank: ""Goodbye, Frank, you know, have a nice trip."" We drop Frank off at the airport. You can also use ""drop off"" in a lot of other situations. For example, when you were a child maybe your parents, your mom or your dad, or maybe your grandparents dropped you off at school. This means that they took you to school, and then once you got to school, they would say goodbye to you and they would leave. So: ""drop off"" means you take someone to a place, and then you leave them there. You'll also notice... So, I have here the verb and the preposition. ""Frank"" is a name of a person and it's in the middle of ""drop"" and ""off"". Okay? So, these two are not together. We drop somebody off at the airport. Okay? So, sometimes with phrasal verbs... For some phrasal verbs you actually separate them, and you can put the names of somebody between them; for other ones you can't do that. For this one: ""drop off"", you put the name between the two... Between the verb and the preposition.

So, now let's look at another example of a common phrasal verb. ""See off"". Okay? So, again, we have ""off"" in both of these. ""See off"" is when... It's similar to ""drop off"", but it's a little bit different. Sometimes your family or your friends are going away for a long time, maybe they're going on a vacation or a trip, so you want to ""see them off"". It means you want to say goodbye to them at the airport, at the train station, maybe at their house. So, it's that goodbye you say before somebody goes off on a vacation. Okay? So, for example: ""We see Frank off."" Frank is going to Australia, so we go to the airport because we want to say goodbye to Frank, so: ""We see Frank off"" is another way to say: ""We say goodbye to Frank when he goes on his trip.""",travel
177,YGwTcfxun,Finland Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Finland.
Finland is a land of a thousand lakes and eternal forests, a land of log cabins and Orthodox churches - a midsummer‚Äôs dream in the extreme north of Europe.Helsinki, ‚ÄòThe Daughter of the Baltic‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Gibraltar of the North‚Äô, a dividing line between east and west and a modern and liberal minded metropolis. Founded in 1550 by Swedish king, Gustav Vasa, as a trading centre, in 1812 Tsar Alexander The First made it the capital of the Principality Of Finland. Turku is the oldest city in Finland and is the country‚Äôs first capital city from where Finnish culture was born. It is still evocative of the Middle Ages. The sea, a magnificent island landscape and picturesque timber houses are typical of one of the oldest cities in the Gulf Of Bothnia, Uusikaupunki. It was there in 1712 that a peace treaty was signed between Russia and Sweden and this small, quiet town has a long maritime history. Further north is a town of seafarers and traders, Kokkola, of which the old town boasts the largest number of timber built houses in Finland. The cleric, Anders Chydenius, once lived here and laid the foundation of Liberalism, the freedom of both religion and trade. Oulu is the flourishing centre of Northern Finland. Along with its many green areas this city by the sea comes alive during the spring and summer months. Despite the harsh climate, tropical plants are popular in the city. The hilly landscape of the spacious Pallas Ounastunturi National Park is located in the north west, close to the Swedish border. Yellow-green reindeer moss and dense layers of many other varieties grow on the seemingly endless hills of primeval stone and gneiss. The plant life of this region always surprises those who encounter it for the first time. Finland is a country that boasts more lakes than any other. It is full of picturesque, natural beauty, unique cultural treasures and historic locations: a tranquil paradise set in the extreme north.

179,Jd1wzlwtKJ0,Kyoto Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Kyoto, Japan, has long been considered one of the country‚Äôs most beautiful cities. Once the capital of the nation, Kyoto is now an ultra-modern haven that retains a great deal of its ancient charm.

To see some of this long-established glamour, make your way to Kyoto Tower. Just two miles east of the tower is Gion, an entertainment quarter and home to many of Kyoto‚Äôs famous geishas. As you walk east through Gion, you‚Äôll find even more old architecture, including several Ryokan, or traditional Japanese inns. Many date back to the Edo period, which ranged from 1603 to 1868. 

During your Kyoto tour, take a rickshaw ride to the Sannen-zaka and Ninen-zaka districts, where cars are prohibited and traditional teahouses and temples adorn the nearby landscape. Kyoto is known as ‚ÄúThe City of Ten Thousand Shrines‚Äù for good reason. Walk through the great open plazas of the Haian Shrine, or spend a quiet moment in the intimate confines of the Shorenin Temple and its beautiful gardens.  

The most famous of Kyoto‚Äôs temples is Fushimi Inari-taisha, a stunning red complex that sprawls over Mount Inari, which is named after and dedicated to Inari, the fox spirit. A hike to the summit takes about two hours, and will lead you through thousands of colorful sub-shrines and thick, ancient forest. Once you‚Äôre at the top, you‚Äôll have a stunning view of Kyoto. 

What is your favorite part of Kyoto?

183,VarCAvDC7jQ,Victoria Falls Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Victoria Falls.
Located in the south of the African continent and located on the Zambia/Zimbabwe border, the Victoria Falls are one of the world's most amazing and impressive wonders of nature.Between February and March when the Zambesi is at its strongest, an average of more than five hundred million litres of water shoot over edge of the waterfall every minute. Indeed, the dimensions of the Victoria Falls beats all records: at an average height of ninety seven metres, the Victoria Falls are around one and a half times as long and also twice as high as the world famous Niagara Falls in North America.Dense tropical rain forests now cover the former basins of earlier waterfalls and have thus created vegetation that would not normally thrive in the surrounding area. According British explorer, David Livingstone, the waterfalls were such an incredible sightthat even passing angels would have been awestruck and amazed by their outstanding beauty. Even a century and a half after they were first discovered the majestic Victoria Falls are still one of the greatest natural spectacles in the world.

Deloreons, blue boxes, hot tubs, we are obsessed with time travel. While mainstream science wants us to believe that time is linear, some are saying that‚Äôs not quite it. Perhaps it is because we are so desperate to want to go back into the past and change our mistakes, or even try to change history itself! Time travel has been, and will always be, a major plot device for fiction. Books and movies will always come up with a new way for their characters to travel through time. But is it possible that time travel could actually exist? According to physicists, time travel does indeed exist and it‚Äôs already happened...several times! Why hasn‚Äôt this made the news? Well, think about it; if there‚Äôs word that time travel is possible, could you imagine the public outcry that would happen? People would say that the past happened for a reason that wasn‚Äôt natural and demand that we go back in time. What if a rip happened in the space-time continuum? There‚Äôs theories that Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves are time travelers too!

In this video, we‚Äôre going to tell you about ten theories that prove time travel actually exists. From disappearing aircraft carriers to modern technology popping up in ancient Greece and Egypt, these stories present a pretty compelling argument that we have the capability to hop around all over the timeline. There are video clips dating back to the early 1900‚Äôs of people walking around and talking on cell phones! Where did they even get their reception? Take a peek at this video and see what we‚Äôre talking about.

186,r3O7ArQTYY,Seoul Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/explore/south...

Welcome to Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Start your adventure at the K-Style Hub, a state-of-the-art visitor centre where South Korea‚Äôs past, present and future converge.
 
At the head of Gwanghwamun Square sits the statue of Sejong the Great, whose reign oversaw a golden age of literature, science and technology. The great leader sits before the grandest of Seoul‚Äôs five royal palaces, Gyeongbokgung, the Palace of Shining Happiness.
 
A short bus or subway ride to the east, are the adjoining palaces of Changdeokgung and Changgyeongung, while just to the south at Deoksugung Palace, see the changing of the guard which takes place three times each day.
Just to the west, is the last of Seoul‚Äôs great palaces, Gyeonghuigung, a royal refuge in times of unrest.
 
After exploring Seoul‚Äôs temple complexes, see how ordinary Koreans once lived at the Namsangol Hanok Village. Then explore the Korea Furniture Museum where over 2000 exquisite items of furniture are displayed within ten traditional houses. The story of Korean craftsmanship continues at the National Museum of Korea, which houses national treasures such as the Ten Story Pagoda.
 
Close to Seoul‚Äôs great South Gate is Namdaemun Market, where locals have been bargaining hard for over 600 years. Looking for some Gangnam style? Head just upriver to Samseong-dong, the Beverly Hills of Seoul.
 
Spend a few hours in the wooded surrounds of the Bongeunsa Buddhist Temple, a peaceful antidote to the fierce pace of Seoul‚Äôs shopping. Then hike to the peak of Namsan, and take in the sweeping views from Seoul‚Äôs iconic tower. When the sun gets low, join locals on the banks of the Han River to see the Banpo Bridge erupt in waves of water and light.",travel

188,Kizu4Lg291g,Genoa (Italy) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Genoa in Italy.
Genoa is the fifth largest city in Italy.  Once a European Capital Of Culture, the city has an historical centre and harbour, as well as palaces, churches and narrow streets. We begin our tour of the city in the Villa Del Principe, a palazzo that was built for famous Admiral Of The Fleet, Andrea Doria, and created by Perino Del Vaga, a pupil of  Raffael. At the harbour, the Commenda Di Pr√© became the crusader‚Äòs hospice of the Order Of Jerusalem, which was followed by the Maltese Order of Knights in the fifteenth century. The Palazzo San Giorgio is the original seat of one of Italy‚Äôs first banks and was where Marco Polo was captured and from where he dictated his travels in China. Porto Antico has been transformed into a fine leisure centre.  A biosphere was created, designed by leading architect, Renzo Piano.  An extraordinary tropical greenhouse contains parrots and small reptiles. Palm trees adorn the promenade which has always been a popular destination for a relaxing stroll. Close to Via San Luca is the Palazzo Spinola, former residence of the noble Spinola Family, it has many original features.  Today it is the Galleria Nazionale featuring the works of international masters and also prominent Genoese artists. The famous Staglieno Cemetery is located near the station.  It is also tantamount to being an open-air museum of sculpture.  The splendour and vibrancy of the memorials is unique, a glorious necropolis. Genoa is portrayed in the cemetery as a cosmopolitan port city in which all religions are accepted in death. The capital of the Liguria region has always been the Gateway To The World, a mediaeval naval power made rich by maritime trade.  Genoa, dominator of the seas, is a metropolis in transition, a city that appeals to all of the senses!

Store your phone and money safely in an empty sunscreen bottle while relaxing on the beach. Clean and dry the bottle and put your things inside.

197,Ps_lCNRNDU,Helsinki Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Helsinki.d178...

Finland‚Äôs thriving waterfront capital, Helsinki, is situated at the northeastern edge of the Baltic Sea between Sweden and Russia.

Start voyaging through Helsinki‚Äôs history by taking the ferry from Market Square to Suomenlinna Fortress, the battlements of which have protected the Gulf of Finland for almost 300 years. 

Helsinki has an abundance of museums and galleries across the city, including the Helsinki Design Museum, which features a permanent exhibition devoted to the great moments of Finnish design.

Continue your design journey at Temppeliaukio Church, a favorite with touring musicians. Helsinki is home to many structures dedicated to theatrical and musical productions. Two of the most iconic are Finlandia Hall and the Helsinki Music Centre. 

Wander through Esplanadi, often referred to as the living room of the city. From here, walk north to Senate Square, which fans out from the fatherly gaze of Emperor Alexander II. 

Climb the stairs to the foot of Helsinki Cathedral, a breathtaking whitewashed structure that towers above the rest of the city. Stare up at the twelve apostles, ten-foot-tall zinc statues which stand like wise custodians. 

In stark contrast to Helsinki Cathedral is its brooding younger brother, Uspenski Cathedral. Built with dark bricks, the cathedral is powerfully conspicuous as it rises from the surrounding white granite of the Katajanokka district. 

Celebrations of education and creativity mean Helsinki is a city designed for life. Its long-held reputation as one of the world‚Äôs happiest places lures people from all over the world. And now, it is calling to you.",travel

Travel video about destination Brazil.
Brazil is a country of both the superlative and also amazing contrast, with dynamic metropolises, cultural centres and untouched nature. It is the largest country on the South American Continent.We begin our journey in Rio De Janeiro, the secret capital of Brazil, a veritable firework display of unashamed joie de vivre, football, samba and religion. The focal point of today‚Äôs Rio is the monumental glass cone of the Catedral Metropolitana that  measures eighty metres high and looks like a Mexican pyramid. The Rua Do Ouvidor, with its elegant old buildings and splendid shops, is a reminder of the city‚Äôs historical and commercial importance. Portuguese settlers founded the city and sugar cane and gold made Rio‚Äôs colonial rulers extremely rich. In former times the coastal towns were protected by fortresses and canons. Paraty was one of those romantic locations, south of Rio on the Costa Verde, a gem dating back to Brazil‚Äôs colonial times. Around five hundred kilometres north of Rio and deep within the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, is a most remarkable place. Ouro Preto was discovered at the end of the seventeenth century by Portuguese gold prospectors who discovered ‚Äòblack gold‚Äô that changed colour due to its iron content. S√£o Paulo is one of the mega cities of the twenty first century and with a population of twenty million it is the economic heart of Brazil. The railway helped to transport cotton and later coffee, and its large station, with British-designed clock tower, became an important  symbol. Brazil is synonymous with sunshine, samba and exotic nature, a dream destination full of both adventure and constant fun!

Travel video about destination Holland.
The European kingdom of Holland, known also as the Netherlands, was until relatively recently a powerful trading nation that possessed many colonies.Most of this land of tulips, windmills and canals is located below sea level and in the 17th century was the most prosperous country in Europe. Amsterdam is Holland`s splendid metropolis, a city of canals and gables where almost anything is permitted as long as it does no harm. Today the view across the main square and royal castle gives little hint that the city is supported by stakes and is the largest lakeland village in the world. In a huge open-air area between Amsterdam and Schiphol Airport, every ten years an international exhibition of garden architecture is held, the Floriade. It features hundreds of blossoming show gardens that are admired by millions of visitors from all over the world. In the 16th century life on the ocean wave brought glorious times for the city of Edam that is now world famous for its cheese of the same name. More than thirty shipyards once prospered in the city and the fleet of legendary Dutch hero, Michiel De Ruyter, was built there. Mijmegen lies proudly on the banks of the River Waal. The origins of Holland‚Äôs oldest city are to be found in the Roman settlement of Noviomagum. The triangular market square of this university and Hanseatic town is dominated by the Waag House, a red-bricked building of Renaissance design. The Molens Van Kinderdijk is a fascinating landscape of windmills and a Unesco World Heritage Sight. Its nineteen windmills are world famous and of course typical of Holland. The fascination of old cities, dreamy fairytale-like villages, paintings by some of the world‚Äôs greatest artists, bicycles and windmill: Holland is very much a land of the familiar and also the exotic.

210,MRI8ffYKA8,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d17831...

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

Transcript:

When anyone asks me about Vancouver I can honestly hand on my heart say, it‚Äôs one of the best places I have ever ever visited. 

Why?

Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver‚Äôs clean air is thanks to it‚Äôs really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn‚Äôt just a place, it‚Äôs a way of life. But it‚Äôs a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we‚Äôre going to help you make the most of it! We‚Äôre going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let‚Äôs get from the airport. 

Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.

Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward ‚Äì a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. 

Another way into the City is the SkyTrain ‚Äì it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.

Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

Now it‚Äôs not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There‚Äôs ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn‚Äôt too bad in our experience.",travel
213,KtRsk4Bjs9,Perth Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Perth.d180013...

A modern city, Perth is the gem of Australia‚Äôs west coast and the capital of Western Australia. This friendly metropolis boasts pristine beaches, clear water, and plenty of coastline ‚Äì not to mention an abundance of nature and mineral resources.

Start your day of Perth sightseeing with a walk through Kings Park, which is larger than New York‚Äôs Central Park and home to the Western Australia Botanic Garden. More than 3,000 species of Western Australia‚Äôs plant life, including vibrant flowers, are on display here. Most of the park consists of bushland, which means lots of wildlife and quite a few walking trails.

After a morning of reflection in the park, head over to the Swan Bell Tower to enjoy a spectacular view of the city. Don‚Äôt forget your camera! You will notice the diverse nature of Perth‚Äôs architecture from this vantage point, including the modern glass structures and London-inspired Tudor buildings. 

Perth tours are never complete without a ferry ride to Rottnest Island, affectionately called ‚ÄúRotto‚Äù by the locals. This getaway is rife with opportunities to snorkel in the Indian Ocean, see wildlife such as seals and birds, and travel across more than 31 miles of cycle ways on a rented bicycle.

Once your feet are back on mainland Western Australia, visit one of the jewels, and ultimately what draws much of the Perth tourism: Swan Valley. This region has a landscape peppered with vineyards, no surprise given that growing grapes has been a long-standing tradition in Swan Valley. Following a short (or leisurely paced) day trip to Swan Valley, return to Perth and head to Hillarys Boat Harbour for a sunset dinner. 

What will you do in Perth?

216,8P-iPXsylrk,Traveling Ecuador by train | DW Travel Documentary,"The train line through Ecuador is considered one of the most spectacular train lines in South America. A train journey of discovery.

The Trans-Andean railroad takes in the infamous Nariz del Diablo, or Devil‚Äôs Nose, a mountain with almost perpendicular walls. To overcome this obstacle, the train zigzags to ascend 500 meters in less than 12 kilometers. With steep ascents and descents, it‚Äôs no ride for the faint-hearted! The main line along the country‚Äôs Andean spine links the coastal city of Guayaquil with the capital Quito. It was finished in 1908, but was mostly shut down after a series of weather-related disasters destroyed much of the Ecuadorian rail network in the 1990s. After extensive restoration, a new cross-Andean service was opened in 2013, following the original narrow-gauge line. It‚Äôs 450 kilometers long and runs from the Pacific coast up to the Andean highlands. On its cross-country journey, the train is accompanied by guards on motorcycles who, in the absence of railway gates, stop traffic at every level crossing along the way to let the train pass. The Tren Crucero, - or ""cruise train""- is the centerpiece of Ecuador‚Äôs rejuvenated railway. A revamped luxury steam train, it runs once a fortnight and has room for 54 passengers. The most exhilarating stretch of the ride begins deep down in the gorge of the River Chanch√°n. The train zigzags up the Nariz del Diablo - the ""Devil's Nose"" - in a series of dizzying switchbacks in which the tracks almost seem to lie on top of each other. Join the reporters for the ride of a lifetime, as the train journeys on to Urbina, the highest station at 3,609 meters above sea level, and along the so-called Avenue of Volcanoes, to the Cotopaxi National Park and onwards to Quito, the world's highest capital.

217,0iehiwf228,Ethiopia Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Ethiopia.
Ethiopia is a mysterious, mountainous land in the Horn Of Africa and birthplace of Early Christianity.  A country of rock churches in the north and a large variety of tribes along the Rift Valley in the south and the oldest civilised region in Africa with more than twenty five centuries of documented history. Addis Abeba is the capital of Ethiopia and within its centre is the lavishly furnished Menbere Selassie Church, final place of rest of Ethiopia‚Äôs last royal family.  It contains the Empress Menen, two princes and Emperor Haile Selassie who, shortly after removal from power, died due to reasons that are in the main controversial. On many of its thirty seven islands, Lake Tana in Northern Ethiopia is well known for its ancient churches and monasteries.  Dega Stefanos is located in the centre of the lake and contains one of the country‚Äôs most important monasteries.  On the summit, framed by walls and hidden under great trees, is the Holy Stefanos Monastery and within a small sanctuary various mummies are preserved within glazed wooden coffins and the remains of five emperors of various dynasties lie at rest. Awash is a settlement on the edge of the nature park of the same name, inhabited by the Afar, a proud and independent tribe.  On market day, people from the surrounding area meet here.  For the Afar, life is hard and only the strong survive.  Corn, tobacco, dates and cotton are the main trading products of this region.  Dromedaries, sheep and goats are bred, and pastureland is often the subject of heated disputes. A journey through Ethiopia is also a journey through time itself.  A land of rich traditions, religions and myths.  A country of legends and contrast that possesses one of the most colourful histories on the African continent.

218,Ys_hUIPta3U,Vanuatu Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia (4K),"https://www.expedia.com/Vanuatu.d192....

The Republic of Vanuatu lies in the South Pacific Ocean, just a short flight from Australia and New Zealand. 
 
Most visitors to Vanuatu arrive at the nation‚Äôs capital, Port Vila, situated on the main island of Efate. Vila, as it‚Äôs affectionately known, sits at the edge of a magnificent natural harbor filled with corals and sea life. 
 
Like many South Pacific ports, Vila is wonderfully relaxed, so leave your designer gear at home, pull on some flip flops and slide into island time. 
 
Just a ten-minute drive from port Vila, is Ekasup Cultural Village, where proud villagers are waiting to share their centuries-old customs, crafts, music and stories. 
 
From Vila, take a 50-minute flight to Espiritu Santo. At the island‚Äôs sleepy capital Luganville, stock up on supplies at the markets, before venturing off to explore the island‚Äôs natural wonders. 
 
After exploring mainland Santo, visit the islands off its southern coast, such as Aore Island,  Bokissa Island and Malo Island. 
 
Just a 45-minute flight south from Port Vila, Tanna Island is fringed with beaches ranging from pure white to black volcanic sands. Many of the hillside villages on Tanna remain largely unaffected by the trappings of the modern world. Feel the earth shake on Mt. Yasur, one of the world‚Äôs most active and accessible volcanoes. 
 
After experiencing the warmth and generosity of Vanuatu‚Äôs people, it‚Äôs easy to feel that Vanuatu could be one of richest places on earth.",travel
219,9fJEFi3ccwI,Yosemite National Park Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Yosemite-Nati...

Yosemite National Park sits on the western slopes of California‚Äôs Sierra Nevada Mountains. Most visitors spend their time in Yosemite Valley, which despite being only 7 miles long and 1 mile wide, packs in more jaw-dropping scenery than just about any other place on Earth. 
 
Near the valley entrance stop at Tunnel View, and stand before a panorama that‚Äôs reduced generations of visitors to silence. From Tunnel View it‚Äôs just a short drive to Bridalveil Fall. Fed by snowmelt, the fall reaches its thundering peak in May. 
 
The Yosemite Valley ring road follows the banks of the Merced River, which shifts in character as it thunders from the valley walls, before gently winding across the valley floor. The ring road is dotted with trailheads that lead to 800 miles of hiking trails. The Four Mile Trail climbs the valley‚Äôs southern wall to two of Yosemite‚Äôs great outlooks, Glacier Point and Washburn Point. Further along the ring road is the trailhead for The Mist Trail, which offers stunning views of Vernal and Nevada Falls. 
 
For thousands of years, the Ahwaneechee had villages throughout this valley, but it was at the base of Yosemite Falls where their great chief resided. Take the one-hour hike to the lower falls, or spend the day climbing all the way to the upper falls.
 
To the north of Yosemite Valley, is Tioga Road, one of the USA‚Äôs most scenic highways. Fill your lungs with alpine air at Olmsted Point, refresh yourself by the waters of Tenaya Lake, then spend the day at Tuolumne Meadow, the traditional summer hunting grounds of the Ahwaneechee. 
 
From its high country to its waterfalls, its towering sequoia groves to its valley meadows, Yosemite is an American story unlike any other.",travel

The following are the best 25 things to do in Berlin, Germany presented in our latest city top attractions travel guide:



1) Visit Berlin Wall - The East Side Gallery
2) Brandenburg Gate
3) Tiergarten
4) MauerPark Flohmarkt (MauerPark Flea Market)
5) Friedrichshain
6) Currywurst 
7) Reichstag building 
8) Tempelhof
9) Berlin's Museum Island
10) Holocaust Memorial - the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe
11) Charlottenburg Palace 
12) Checkpoint Charlie
13) Alexanderplatz - The Berlin TV Tower 
14) Ritter Sport 
15) Berlin Cathedral
16) Currywurst Museum
17)  Rent a bike and go riding
18) River spree boat tour
19) Eat a Wurst sausage
20) Friedrichshain Flohmarkt (flea market)
21) Eat a German Breakfast
22) Cat Cafe (Pee Pees Katzen Cafe)
23) Schnitzel and Spaetzle
24) U-bahn and S-bahn metro system
25) Turkish Food 

The East Side Gallery is the longest remaining strip of the of the former dividing wall between East and West Berlin. Today the 1.3 kilometer long wall stands as a memorial to freedom and it is covered in art and graffiti. Right now we're visiting Brandenburg Gate.  This gate dates back to the 18th Century. We're here at Tiergarten, one of the biggest parks in the city. MauerPark is a hipster hangout. If you head over to the Bear Pit you can catch some karaoke and musical performances. If you want to spot some cool street art, then head over to Friedrichshain. You can't come to Berlin and not eat a Currywurst! This is the city's most popular fast food snack. The sausage is served with a ketchup and curry powder concoction. Up next we're at the Reichstag building which has a pretty cool glass dome on top.  This dome is actually open to visitors and it offers 360 degree views of the city. Today we're visiting Tempelhof, a re-purposed airport here in Berlin for leisure activities and sports. If you enjoy museums and art galleries you'll want to visit Berlin's Museum Island.  They actually have five different museums here and if you get a daily pass for 18 Euros you get access to all five. We are now visiting the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin.  It is also known as the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Charlottenburg Palace is the largest palace in Berlin and the only surviving royal residence in the city. Checkpoint Charlie was one of the crossing points between East Berlin and West Berlin during the Cold War. Located near Alexanderplatz, The Berlin TV Tower offers a great lookout over the city. Chocolate! Ritter Sport is a chocolate brand that is sold all over Germany, and while in Berlin we couldn't resist sampling a few of the different varieties. Berlin Cathedral is located on Museum Island and it's one of the most beautiful churches in the city. If Currywurst is to your liking, you'll want to check out this quirky museum devoted to Berlin's favorite sausage. Renting a bike is a great way to get around the city. Most places will rent out bikes at 10 Euros per day. For a leisurely afternoon, hop on a boat and enjoy a tour down the River Spree. Of course, you cannot come to Berlin and not eat a Wurst or a sausage. The Friedrichshain flea market takes place every Sunday and it's a great place for people watching and a little browsing. The Germans sure know how to enjoy a hearty breakfast, and we recommend you try it too. 
We couldn't resist visiting yet another cat cafe while we were in Berlin. 
While in Berlin we enjoyed a hearty meal of Schnitzel. It's quite easy to get around Berlin using the U-bahn and S-bahn system. In Berlin, there is a big Turkish population and that means there is awesome Turkish street food.  And that's Berlin for you! A city that has risen from the ashes of the war, which is now bursting with art, music, and life. 

Have you been to Berlin? We'd love to hear your favourite things about the city in the comments below.

The island of Santorini has a pretty explosive past. It‚Äôs perched over the remains of a much larger land mass that sank almost 4,000 years ago when a volcano blew its top, leaving the blue caldera and steep cliffs behind. 

It is these cliffs and the flooded caldera that have become Santorini‚Äôs iconic calling card, and the first stop on your Santorini tour. Here‚Äôs your first bit of trivia: The whitewashed homes that appear on so many postcards and photographs are larger than they appear on the outside. They‚Äôre partially built into existing cliffside caves, and feature some of the most distinctive Mediterranean architecture you‚Äôll ever see. 

Santorini sightseeing will no doubt bring you up the stairs and pathways to the blue-domed churches that stand guard over the island. From there, you can take in the exquisite view of the caldera and harbor below. If you get a little weary of the spectacular sights, don‚Äôt worry; there‚Äôs plenty of things to do besides wander the various clifftop towns. If you head down to water level, you can soak in the warm surf, explore Santorini‚Äôs many beaches, go for a drive along winding roads, or go on a fishing expedition from one of the harbors. 

At the end of the day, gather with the residents and visitors atop the cliff towns and watch the sun drop into the ocean. You‚Äôll never see a view quite like it.

What part of Santorini do you want to see?

Portland, Saco, Cape Porpoise and Kennebunkport sit on the southern coastline of Maine. Part of Portland‚Äôs great charm is its working waterfront.

Amble down Commercial Street and spend a few hours drifting around the many wharves and piers. Then, follow the salty breezes through the streets and lanes of the historic port district. 

Tour the ornate rooms of Victoria Mansion, and visit the historic home of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of America‚Äôs most beloved poets. Head west along Congress Street to the Portland Museum of Art. Many of the artists whose works feature here were inspired by Portland‚Äôs coastline, including one of the giants of American Art, Winslow Homer. 

Cross the Fore River to South Portland and peer through the gun ports of Historic Fort Preble. Just below the fort is the Spring Point Ledge Light, one of the smaller of Maine‚Äôs 57 active lighthouses, while just a few miles south, on Cape Elizabeth, stands one of New England‚Äôs most beautiful, Portland Head Light. 

Seven miles south of Portland is Scarborough, where families have been returning to sleepy havens like Higgins Beach for generations. From here, let the bend of Saco Bay sweep you further south to Saco, Cape Porpoise and Kennebunkport. 

On your way back to Portland, grab a ticket and take a ride at the Seashore Trolley Museum, the largest collection of streetcars in the world.

Welcome to Portland. It‚Äôs more than just a city by the sea, it‚Äôs a song.",travel

230,GEFB4s4NrP,Is time travel possible? Brian Cox and Nalini Joshi offer their views | Q & A,"A questioner on ABC's Q&A asks whether it is possible for a person who invents a time machine in the future to travel back in time and show us how to make one. Panelists Nalini Joshi and Professor Brian Cox give their views.

More science here: 

More Q&A here: 

Brian Cox says you can't travel into the past, but Nalini Joshi disagrees.

""Well, I don't know about whether there's an arrow that prevents you from going to the past or only into the future but, mathematically, I think that there are many, many possible answers to these questions. If I may? You know, if you take just a three dimensional cube and you look at one corner of this three-dimensional cube and then you compress one corner down to the diagonally opposite corner, then what you do is you flatten the cube and it becomes a hexagon. If you take that structure, which is hexagonally symmetric, it turns out that these types of symmetries are in crystals and there are a very knew few number of these regular symmetries that are exhibited in crystals in two dimensions. Now, if you think about increasing the number of dimensions, now go to three, four, five, six, presto, around 7 and 8 there are exceptional new structures that come up, that only exist when you get to 7 and 8 and maybe 9 dimensions.""",travel

This video is an explanation of how time travel functions in different popular movies, books, & shows ‚Äì not how it works ‚Äúunder the hood"", but how it causally affects the perspective of characters‚Äô timelines (who has free will? can you change things by going back to the past or forwards into the future?).

Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
New Zealand has a lot to offer even the most particular traveller. From the lively neighbourhoods of Wellington to the breathtaking Fiordland of the South Island, there's an adventure tucked away in every corner of this impressive country. Consider living out your own Lord of the Rings adventure in Hobbiton, or hike past Mt. Doom in Tongariro National Park. Not thrilling enough? Then skydive over Auckland, go white water rafting down Kaituna River or take a leap of faith and bungee jump in Queenstown! When you're in New Zealand, nearly ever adventure is only a stone's throw away. 

Make the most out of your visit to this remote island nation by assembling your bucket list with our travel guide. Booking a tour will ensure your trip is fun, flawless and stress-free: 


New Zealand boasts a temperate climate with plenty of sunshine and moderate rainfall. Because of the long coast line, you can expect mild temperatures for the most part. The average temperature decreases as you travel south; January and February are the warmest months with July being the coldest month of the year. Remember to pack your waterproof hiking boots, waterproof rain jacket, swimsuit, flip flops, thin gloves, hiking socks, sunglasses, and a camera with extra batteries. 

New Zealand's currency is the New Zealand Dollar (NZ$). You should expect to be able to switch between cash and cards quite seamlessly, as all major credit cards can be used in New Zealand. Alcohol and restaurant meals can range from moderate to quite expensive so prepare yourself accordingly.

We'd like to thank New Zealand's incredible tourism board for allowing use of their travel footage: 

---About New Zealand---

New Zealand, exists on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and is home to over 4.6 million people, and nearly 30 million sheep. 

The country is divided into two portions: the North and South Islands separated by the Cook Strait. The North Island is home to many hot springs and geysers while the South Island is mountainous, forested and covered in glaciers. Over 75% of New Zealanders call the North Island home, and more than 15% of New Zealand's energy comes from renewable resources.

253,MRI8ffYKA8,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d17831...

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

Banff, located in Banff National Park in the Canadian Rockies, is one part resort town and one part breathtaking natural retreat.

Life is a little different at over 4,600 feet in elevation‚Äîby the way, that makes Banff Canada‚Äôs highest town. During your Banff sightseeing, you‚Äôll learn that the town‚Äôs residents and visitors are a lively bunch, and you‚Äôll find the local businesses are perfect for this festive crowd. Choose from over 100 restaurants to dine at, or stop by one or two of the dozens of pubs and cafes for an inexpensive snack and drink after walking through the many boutiques. You can also enjoy a marvelous time after the sun goes down; try dancing the night away at the Dancing Sasquatch, or visiting one of Banff‚Äôs other nightclubs. 

Banff National Park is known for its wildlife, some of which frequents Banff itself. You‚Äôll often spot deer at the outskirts of town, some of which are friendly and curious about people. Once you say hello to the deer, make the drive to nearby Johnston Canyon, where you can take in snow-capped alpine scenery straight out of a fairy tale. 

Warm up after all this time spent outside: head to the Banff Upper Hot Springs. This exquisite spa has treated visitors to hot water and stunning views of the Rockies for over a century, and will continue to do so for a century to come.

What will you do on your Banff tour?

257,4z6RZXv5p8,Interstellar Travel: Approaching Light Speed,"Is interstellar travel doomed to remain in the realm of science fiction? Sticking to near future space propulsion only, how close can we get to the speed of light?

This video looks at the current spacecraft speed records with Apollo 10 holding the record for the fastest manned spacecraft, New Horizons probe for the fastest Earth escape velocity and the Helios probes for the fastest heliocentric velocity. But Solar Probe Plus will beat that when it launches in 2018. While Voyager 1 doesn't set any speed records, it was the first spacecraft to leave the solar system, so therefore the fastest solar system escape velocity by default.

For beating these speeds, this video explores what is possible in the near future only, so no antimatter, Alcubierre drives (warp), ramjets, etc... The EM drive is left out until it's proven with actual reproducible results in space.

Project Daedalus and the updated Project Icarus represent sound concepts for fusion spacecraft. IKAROS was the first successful demonstration of solar sail technology but hopefully the planetary society is not far behind with their LightSail cubsat (not covered in this video).

But what appears to have the most potential to reach the nearest star to our own, Proxima Centauri and it's newly discovered planet Proxima b is Breakthrough Starshot. Thousands of super lightweight laser sail nanocraft will be launched into space then the light beamer, a ground based laser array will propel these spacecraft to 20% light speed within minutes.

266,I1QBHhbS0,Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180...

The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg‚Äôs fairytale setting.
 
Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and provided the settings for one of cinema‚Äôs most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. 
  
Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe‚Äôs best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you‚Äôll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. 
 
Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Caf√© Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the M√ºllner Br√§u Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world. 
 
Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg‚Äôs southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.
 
While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city‚Äôs most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town.

269,ZwcnQ0d667I,Peru Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Peru.
Lima is the capital of Peru, the second largest country in South America after Brazil and Argentina.The Palacio De Gobierno is also known as Pizzarro, or Government Palace. This Neo-Classic building was completed in 1938 and stands on the foundation of the former Pizzarro Palace. In the palace gardens is the house in which Pizzarro was killed. Lima, the City of Kings, became the capital of the largest region in Spanish South America and was where the viceroys of the Spanish crown resided. During colonial times this city was the largest, most populated, finest and most cultivated city on the continent. Some of the most beautiful colonial buildings in South America are to be found in Lima‚Äôs old town along with carved balconies of Moorish origin. Huaraz is the 3,050 metre high capital of the Departamento Ancash in the White Mountain range, the Cordillera Blanca. Several natural catastrophes destroyed the majority of the old houses and many people were killed. In 1824 Simon Bolivar built his headquarters there prior to his bloody struggle for Peru‚Äôs independence. The valley oasis of Nazca which played an important role during the early history of Peru is a desolate area in the south of the country. A small airport is the starting point of a journey to one of the world‚Äôs greatest mysteries, the enigma of Nazca culture: images of humans, animals and geometric forms scattered over an area of 1,000 km¬≤ like the pages of some fantastic historical and astronomical book, created by the Nazca between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D.The 8,300 km¬≤ Lake Titicaca is located at an altitudeof 4,000 m in the Andes Mountains on the border that divides Peru and Bolivia. Then there‚Äôs Machu Picchu, the Lost City Of The Incas! Peru is a country full of mystery and ancient history. A land of mountains, desert and jungle. A precious gem on the edge of the world!

270,nN2BNrSrXY,Moscow Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Your trip to Moscow, Russia is bound to be a special one. From the multicolored spires of St. Basil‚Äôs Cathedral to the sturdy red walls of the Kremlin, there is much to see and do in this stunning city.

Named after the Moskva River‚Äîwhich flows through the city‚ÄîMoscow has long been at the forefront of the creative world. Tour Moscow to follow in the footsteps of Tolstoy and Chekhov, among others, and join in the sense of pride Russia feels for its literary tradition. Moscow has named a number of its parks and open spaces after its poets and authors, so take a break at the fountain in Pushkin Square, or rest beneath the leafy trees in Gorky Park. When you‚Äôve gotten your fill of literary splendor, head to the Memorial Museum of Cosmonauts, where you can learn about the Soviet Union‚Äôs efforts to reach the stars and the epic space race that lasted from 1955 to 1972.

Moscow is a city of creativity and innovation, but is also very much aware of its own history; as such, a haunting part of any Moscow sightseeing is a visit to the Fallen Monument Park. After the fall of the Soviet Union, countless statues and monuments were removed from their pedestals and moved to this park. Over the years, more modern artwork and sculptures have been added, turning the park into a strange, yet peaceful graveyard of former icons.

What is your favorite part of Moscow?

Patagonia, the fabled ‚Äòedge of the world‚Äô, spans the southernmost regions of Chile and Argentina and can be rugged and desolate as well as breathtakingly beautiful and inviting.

This last frontier of South America is a colorful mosaic of snow-capped mountains,  icebergs, volcanoes, glaciers, forests, lakes and vast steppe plains.

On the Argentinean side, the scenic Road of the 7 Lakes takes you from San Mart√≠n de los Andes to Villa La Angostura and finally San Carlos de Bariloche, a popular ski resort on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi.

El Chalt√©n, in the southern Andes, is Argentina‚Äôs trekking capital. Trails lead to Laguna Capri, Fitz Roy Mountain and the fearsome Cerro Torre.

El Calafate is nestled the southern shores of Lago Argentino and is the gateway lake to Los Glaciares National Park. Here, one of the world‚Äôs most awe-inspiring glaciers awaits: the Perito Moreno Glacier.

In the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia, take the 'End of the World Train‚Äô to Tierra del Fuego National Park or get there by boat over the Beagle Channel. Photo opportunities along the way include Bird Island, Seal Island and the historic Les √âclaireurs lighthouse.

On the Chilean side of Patagonia, the regional capital Punta Arenas attracts visitors with its colonial architecture, cultural attractions and hospitality.

Tour the region‚Äôs Milod√≥n Cave, where the remains of a giant ground-dwelling sloth and other huge extinct species were found.

Torres del Paine National Park is great for horse riding or hiking, with its steppes, snowcapped peaks, brimming lakes and Salto Grande waterfalls.

On the northern border of Chilean Patagonia, in the Los Lagos region, looms the mighty Osorno Volcano. The town of Puerto Varas, on the opposite shores of Lake Llanquihue, marks the end your Patagonia expedition.

Atlanta, Georgia, is home to 5.5 million people. When you venture into the lush foliage that engulfs much of Atlanta and frames its many skyscrapers, you‚Äôll immediately understand why it‚Äôs referred to as ‚ÄúThe City in a Forest.‚Äù 

An Atlanta tour must include the Atlanta History Center. Learn about the city‚Äôs roots as a railways terminal, as well as its role in the Civil War, when it was nearly burned to the ground. Fact became fiction when Margaret Mitchell featured Atlanta as a major setting in her novel, ‚ÄúGone With the Wind,‚Äù and you can learn about the author and the book at the Margaret Mitchell House and Museum.

Stop by the Martin Luther King Jr. Historic Site to learn about the Civil Rights leader, and pay your respects at his final resting place. From there, your Atlanta sightseeing should continue at the Georgia Aquarium, where you can meet some beluga whales, swim with whale-sharks, and get up close and personal with sealife in the touch tanks. 

Cap off a beautiful day with a trip to Stone Mountain Park. If you take the Summit Skyride, you‚Äôll get an outstanding view of the city.

292,VfBQNENS9,Berlin Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Welcome to Berlin, the capital city of Germany.

The first documentation of Berlin appears in the 13th century, and it has a long history of importance‚Äîit‚Äôs been the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Kingdom of Prussia, among others. The lengthy history encompassing the city often manifests in its eclectic collection of architecture, which you should certainly include on your Berlin tour.

From the towering classical lines of Charlottenburg Palace, built for the Hohenzollern family in the 17th century, to the sleek mirrored sides of the Bahn Tower, you‚Äôre bound to find plenty to look at in the city‚Äôs downtown area. Fancy a real German lager? Stop by Prater Garten for a brew‚Äîbuilt in 1837, it‚Äôs one of the handful of buildings that has survived both World Wars. You can sit outside and responsibly enjoy your drink, or, if the weather turns on you, head inside to enjoy a hearty German meal. 

Ready to check out the rest of the city? You‚Äôre in luck. Berlin sightseeing is easy: Though the sprawling city has excellent public transit, Berlin is geared toward pedestrians, and you can access much of the city center on food or by bicycle. For a truly extraordinary experience, visit Museum Island, located in the Spree River. It features five museums, among them the Altes, completed in 1830 and devoted to antiquities. The newest structure on the premises, built in 1930, is the Pergamon Museum. Here you can explore the art of numerous cultures, or wander through a replica of the Ishtar Gate. 

Are you one of those people who only starts to wake up after the sun goes down? If you‚Äôre looking for a thriving nightlife, Berlin is the place to go. When the sun sets on the city, the party really begins, and you can find any number of clubs where you can dance until long after the sun comes up. 

Where will you go in Berlin?

SIM CARD
Another options is to get a SIM card for your unlocked mobile device.  You can go to most major electronics store and they should carry it.  There are a few options, but I‚Äôll cover the 2 basic types that I think is the best  for travelers.  

(1)  SIM card with a daily data transfer limits 220mb per day. You can get it for 7 days or 15 days.  

(2) SIM cards with a total data transfer limit of 1.5 Gb or 3GB that work for 30 day period.  It doesn‚Äôt have a daily transfer limit which I personally prefer.  And if I use up all the data in only a few days, you can just buy a new card.

Subscribe: https://goo.gl/GmtyPv

Everyone has thought about time travel at least once in their life. Maybe you‚Äôve wanted to go back in time and try to change something from your past. There‚Äôs even a lot of science fiction movies out there that involve time travel, or were inspired by time travel in some way or another. But is it really possible to travel back or forward in time? And if it really is possible, what would we have to do in order to make time travel a reality? 

The very thought about time travel and what it would take to make it a reality is mind-boggling. It is something that scientists, especially astrophysicists, have long thought about. The most fantastic thing? It's probably possible. We should probably start off with the bad news about time travel. We probably can‚Äôt travel back in time and watch the Egyptians build the pyramids. However, there are a number of theories that have suggested that it is possible to take a leap forward in time. But going back in time is far more complicated. That‚Äôs not saying it‚Äôs impossible though. 

The great 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. While most people think of time as a constant, Einstein showed that time is an illusion; it is relative in that it can vary for different observers depending on your speed through space. The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren't about what we experience in everyday life, but other scientists have confirmed this theory. The theory says that space and time are really aspects of the same thing which is called ‚Äòspace-time‚Äô. There is a speed limit of 300,000 kilometers per second (or 186,000 miles per second) for anything that travels through space-time, and light always travels this speed limit through empty space. 

So more about this illusion of time, ‚ÄòSpecial Relativity‚Äô says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time, especially when your speed relative to other objects is close to the speed of light. Time goes slower for you than for the people you left behind. You won't notice this effect until you return to those stationary people. 

So as an experiment, let‚Äôs say you were 15 years old and you left Earth in a spacecraft traveling at about close to the speed of light, and you celebrated only five birthdays during your space voyage. When you got home at the age of 20, you would find that all your classmates who were the same age as you when you left were 65 years old, retired, and hanging out with their grandchildren! The reason for this is because as time passed more slowly for you, you would have experienced only five years of life, while your classmates will have experienced a full 50 years.",travel

300,X2LxnQ,Travel Deep Inside a Leaf - Annotated Version | California Academy of Sciences,"Please turn on subtitles with the CC (Closed Captions) button to see the explanatory annotations designed for educators.

Transcript of closed captions:

0:05: We are approaching a redwood tree. To animate a scientifically accurate leaf, artists studied the texture of a redwood leaf specimen on a glass slide at high resolution. They even counted the stomata, and used that exact count for this film!

0:25: These leaves would be measured on a centimeter scale. Throughout the animation, we will gradually zoom in to smaller scales.

0:40: As we approach a single stoma, we are now on a millimeter scale.

0:48: As we enter the interior of the leaf, we see many individual palisade cells.  These cells are where photosynthesis takes place; they are translucent to allow sunlight to enter.  

1:00: As we approach a single palisade cell, we‚Äôll zoom down to the micrometer scale.  The shapes inside the cell are organelles: the bright globules at the bottom are the Golgi apparatus; the yellow spotted tubes are endoplasmic reticulum studded with ribosomes.  

1:09: That large, blue membrane surrounds the nucleus; the purple blobs are mitochondria.

1:18: The faint, yellow, spider-web structure of the cytoskeleton provides structure and support to the cell.

1:24:  You are about to enter a chloroplast; inside you see flat, pancake-like membranous structures called thylakoids.  This is where the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis take place to produce ATP, the cell‚Äôs energy carrier molecule. way


1:38:  The time scale has changed:  the molecules are shown moving 1 million times slower than in real life!

1:42: As we near an individual thylakoid, the animation scale continues to shrink down to the molecular level, where things are measured in nanometers.


1:52: The green and blue bush-like structures are photosystems: clusters of proteins that absorb light energy from the sun and help convert it into the chemical energy that‚Äôs stored in the bonds of the energy carrier molecule called ATP.

2:03: The yellow-green, rotating structure is an enzyme called ATP synthase.  It pumps protons from one side of the thylakoid membrane to the other, assembling ATP molecules in the process.  

2:16: The pulses of light in the thylakoid membrane in which the photosystems are embedded represent energized electrons being passed from one photosystem to another, passing along the energy which will be stored in the bonds of ATP (the classic ‚Äúbucket brigade‚Äù).

2:26: The small ‚Äúwigglies‚Äù are ATP molecules.  Living things store energy in the bonds of the ATP molecules and then use that energy to conduct all the processes of life.  

This animation is a model, and has its strengths and limitations. In order to model something well, visual artists have to make decisions about what to represent and how best to do so. What‚Äôs present in this model, and what‚Äôs intentionally missing or altered? Find out by visiting

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. 

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. 

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",travel

309,ieWNzZPfZzk,Rio de Janeiro Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Rio-de-Janeiro...

The early morning in Rio de Janeiro brings quiet, misty coastlines and pink-purple sunrises. The Brazilian locals are up and about soon enough, piling onto the beautiful beaches and expressing themselves through artwork, dance, and the ubiquitous Rio de Janeiro partying. 

A Rio de Janeiro tour must stop at Christ the Redeemer, the ubiquitous statue that watches over the city from above the Tijuca National Forest. Take the cable car to the lookout point on Sugarloaf Mountain, the city‚Äôs iconic peak, and try not to look down ‚Äì it‚Äôs a long way to drop!

After a morning spent in nature, your Rio de Janeiro sightseeing should continue in the city proper. Join the sun worshippers at Copacabana, where you can stake out a patch of beach or float out to sea with the paddleboarders. Shop for souvenirs in Ipanema, or take part in the street dances, festivals, and parades that may spontaneously break out. 

The ‚ÄúCidade Maravilhosa,‚Äù or the marvelous city, has much to offer all of its visitors. What impression will it leave with you?

Transcript:

Welcome to Lisbon!

Lisbon is Portugal's unassumingly cool capital and western Europe's oldest city that serves over 12 million tourists every year. Way back in 1755 the city was hit by a huge earthquake that destroyed 85% of buildings. The city had no choice but to rebuild itself and the 18th century architecture that reshaped Lisbon is still very dominant today. In fact if you come here, don‚Äôt be surprised to spend most of your time looking up and admiring it as you wander through the fairy tale cobbled streets lined with iconic Portuguese tiles that have inspired artists for generations. Each building and street really does have its own personality. What‚Äôs more, amongst this wealth of history, is an eclectic city renowned for having colourful nightlife, tonnes of culture, music and a cosmopolitan food scene that modestly boasts the best custard tarts on the planet! This city break is ideal all year round, with temperatures rarely going below 10 degrees celsius in the winter and averaging 25 in the summer. It really does seem like Lisbon has it all, and we're here to show you why‚Ä¶

Coming up we‚Äôre going to take you through our top tips for 48 hours in Lisbon. From transport, things to do, places to see, lingo, and where to buy the best custard tarts in the city. We‚Äôve done the research to save you time and help you have the most amazing trip. So let‚Äôs start with how to get here.

The flight from London Gatwick takes just over 2 and a half hours straight into Lisbon‚Äôs only airport which is conveniently just 7km from the heart of the city. 

The best thing about Lisbon Airport is it‚Äôs only a 20 minute drive into the city centre. The easiest way to get in is to jump in a taxi or take the Aerobus. There are two lines running into the main hotel areas that cost ‚Ç¨4 per person each way. 

Alternatively you could take the metro that runs from 6am to 1am everyday or there‚Äôs always the city bus but do expect for both these options to take a little longer. 

Lisbon is known as the city of seven hills so to save your legs from all that climbing you‚Äôll probably gonna want to use public transport at some point. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to get around the city - from train, tram, metro, bus and even funicular lift.

The metro is good choice if you‚Äôre traveling long distances but doesn‚Äôt cover all areas of the city. It‚Äôs one of cleanest metros in Europe, and most stations are open from 6am to 1am every day. 

Trams cover areas of the city where there is no access to the metro. There are two types of trams, the yellow ‚ÄúRemodelado‚Äù trams that route round the old narrow streets and then there‚Äôs modern ‚ÄúArticulado‚Äù trams that operate along the flat sections of the city connecting central Lisbon to the Belem district.

Lisbon has hundreds of buses and 88 different routes so you‚Äôre bound to find one to take you where you need to go. 

The funicular lifts are used to help locals and tourists climb all those hills. The most famous lift is the Santa Justa Lift linking lower and upper Lisbon. Yes, it‚Äôs technically a means of public transport  but it also doubles up a a major tourist attraction and has great a view point at the top. 

We noticed a lot of tourists jumping in Tuk Tuks, and so we thought we‚Äôd give it a go. But it turns out the cobbled streets of Lisbon don‚Äôt make for a comfy ride in a Tuk Tuk, and if I‚Äôm honest a 5 minute ride was a bit of a rip off at ‚Ç¨15.

Working out the best way to pay for transport in Lisbon can get confusing‚Ä¶ so here‚Äôs our simple breakdown‚Ä¶",travel

The most important places to visit in Sydney are: Sydney Opera House , Set on the Sydney harbor, Sydney Harbor Bridge (simply called ""the bridge"" by locals, courageous ones can even climb up the bridge), Bronte Beach (lesser known than Bondi, it is a beautiful beach, popular amongst families), Blue Mountains (an unspoiled mountain range filled with Eucalyptus trees. It is located 30 miles from Sydney, and there are plenty of hiking trails), Bondi Beach (Sydney's most famous beach, its lively promenade is as exciting as the beach) and many more.

Welcome to Seattle, a city that straddles the modern world and the natural one.

While it‚Äôs known for its overcast weather, when the sun comes out in Seattle, you‚Äôre in for the perfect photo op, where blue skies and calm seas surround classic architecture and striking modern buildings. Take in a view of the city from the Observation Deck of Smith Tower, then head down to the waterfront for incredible seafood and harbor cruises.

Visit the world-famous Pike Place Market, home to fresh catches, local produce, and yes, the world‚Äôs first Starbucks¬Æ. From there, explore the great outdoors at Woodland Park Zoo, full of recreated savannahs and tropical rainforests. If you‚Äôre still craving more natural wonders, go to Olympic National Park a few hours away and meander through its scenic, wooded beauty.

Round out your Seattle sightseeing with Ruby Beach and pick your way through the driftwood scattered across the shore. Look out to the ocean, watch the sunset, and know you‚Äôre in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started ‚Äútravel hacking‚Äù and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

340,lF8byCyRJ2g,London (United Kingdom) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"‚ú± 12800 Hotels in London - Lowest Price Guarantee ‚ñ∫ https://booki.ng/2DFsetA

Travel video about destination London in England.
London is an exciting and pulsating metropolis of the new millennium, a melting pot of both people and culture and a fascinating city of diverse contrasts.

The City Of London contains the Tower, an historic landmark with a remarkable history. A mighty medieval fortress with 13 towers that throughout its 900 years, has served many functions and from the Middle Ages, it was a heavily fortified prison.

After the medieval St. Paul's Cathedral was destroyed by a devastating fire in 1666, Christopher Wren was ordered to re-build it with a dome. During the 36 years of its construction, its design was frequently altered until finally a wonderful masterpiece of church architecture was created.

The Monument is the city's tallest freestanding stone column and a reminder of the Great Fire of London that destroyed 80 percent of the city. In four days, more than 13,000 buildings were destroyed and the Monument was built on the site of the bakery in which the fire began.

Since the reign of Queen Victoria, Buckingham Palace has served as London's royal residence. A garden of mulberry trees once grew on the site of today's palace and the Duke of Buckingham subsequently added a simple brick built residence. Around 60 years later, George II purchased the site for his wife and George IV eventually began to design an extensive palace complex.

The highlight of any holiday in London must be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, the London Eye. Situated on the banks of the Thames, it rises high into the sky, opposite the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben.

The former centre of the largest empire in the world, London is still a city of superlatives that attracts millions of visitors each year. Exciting both day and night, London is a modern city with age old traditions and a long and colorful history.

341,dZYpHr1wDmY,Budapest Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Budapest.d179...

The Hungarian capital, Budapest, is situated on the banks of the Danube in Central Europe. It‚Äôs the political, economic and cultural heart of the nation, and one of the most beautiful and livable cities on the continent.
  
For a sweeping overview of the city head to the Buda side of the Danube and take in the views from the 19th century ramparts on Gell√©rt Hill. Just upriver is Budapest‚Äôs oldest area, The Castle District, home to Buda Castle, Matthias Church and Fisherman‚Äôs Bastion.
 
Once you‚Äôve explored the heights of Castle Hill, cross the Sz√©chenyi Chain Bridge to the Pest side of the city and follow the riverbank upstream to Hungary‚Äôs Parliament Building. Nearby, pay your respects at the Shoes on the Danube Memorial, a sobering tribute to the thousands who were executed here during The Second World War.
 
After admiring the magnificent dome of St. Stephen‚Äôs Basilica, allow yourself to be swept up Andrassy Avenue. This world heritage listed boulevard opens out onto Heroes‚Äô Square and City Park.  The park is home to the Sz√©chenyi Thermal Baths, just one of the city‚Äôs many lavish bathhouses. For many in Budapest, ‚Äútaking the waters‚Äù is a weekly ritual.
 
Whether it‚Äôs the sparkling Danube or the thermal springs, there‚Äôs something truly rejuvenating in the water here. So when you‚Äôre ready to experience moments of refection, inspiration, and sublime beauty, come to Budapest, you‚Äôre sure to come away rejuvenated too.",travel

Following is the transcript of the video:

Brian Greene: I‚Äôm Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University and co-founder of the World Science Festival.

It's critical that you realize that there are two types of time travel, and they are radically different. Time travel to the future? Definitely possible.

We know how to do it because Einstein showed us the way over a hundred years ago. It‚Äôs surprising how few people actually really know about this in their bones. He showed that if you go out into space and travel near the speed of light, and you turn around, and you come back, your clock will be ticking off time more slowly. So, when you step off it's going to be the future on planet Earth. You will have time traveled into the future.

He also showed that if you hang out near a nice strong source of gravity ‚Äî a neutron star, a black hole ‚Äî and you kind of get right near the edge of that object, time also for you would slow down real slow relative to everybody else. And therefore, when you come back to Earth, for instance, it'll again be far into the future.

This is not controversial stuff. Any physicist who knows what they're talking about agrees with this. But the other kind of time travel ‚Äî to the past is where the arguments start to happen because many of us don't think that time travel to the past is possible.

The main proposal that people at least consider worthy of attention for traveling to the past does make use of a weird concept called wormholes. A wormhole is something that really ‚Ä¶ Albert Einstein again discovered. The guy has like got his name written over everything in this field.

It's a bridge, if you will, from one location space to another. It's kind of a tunnel that gives you a shortcut to go from here to here. Now he discovered this in 1935 but it was subsequently realized that if you manipulate the openings of a wormhole ‚Äî put one near a black hole or take one on a high-speed journey ‚Äî then time of the two openings of this wormhole tunnel will not take off at the same rate, so that you will no longer just go from one location in space to another, if you go through this tunnel ‚Äî through this wormhole ‚Äî you'll go from one moment in time to a different moment in time. Go one way, you'll travel to the past, the other way, travel to the future.

Now again, we don't know if wormholes are real. We don't know if they are real whether you'll be able to go through them. So, there are all sorts of uncertainties here. Most of us think that you're not going to actually go on a whirlwind journey through a wormhole to the past. But it's still not ruled out.",travel

345,GHDtG4_Eq_,Philadelphia Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Philadelphia....

Welcome to Philadelphia, considered the birthplace of the United States.

The Declaration of Independence was written and read publicly here in 1776. When you tour Philadelphia, you‚Äôll get a sense of the history that permeates the city through its numerous monuments, symbols, and other landmarks, such as the First Bank of the United States and the warship USS Olympia. Don‚Äôt forget to stop by the Liberty Bell and the remains of the Eastern State Penitentiary, which housed notorious criminals like Al Capone. 

You don‚Äôt need a car to enjoy your Philadelphia sightseeing; take public transportation or rent a bike to explore the city streets at your leisure. Fairmount Park is the perfect place for a stroll, and if you‚Äôve got kids, bring them to the Please Touch Museum, where they can enjoy interactive exhibits and displays that will educate and entertain. If you‚Äôve still got some energy after that, visit the Philadelphia Zoo and make friends with some of the animals. Don‚Äôt forget to sample some of the delicious food available in Philadelphia, particularly the fresh goods and cooked meals at the Italian Market. 

From culinary delicacies to historical importance, Philadelphia truly has it all. 

Visit our Philadelphia travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

346,2CyfAdTNM,9 Travel Outfit Ideas (Wear This Not That),"Today I will share 9 travel outfit ideas for the airplane.  I am going to show you a piece of clothing and say, ""Wear this not that."" I will help you know what to wear and what not to wear when you travel.  How you dress in an airplane will help you be more comfortable in your outfit.  You will worry less about stains, you will be at ease when you are sitting and bending over, and you will not be self conscious about what you are wearing. Since we are an airline family, I have come up with 9 travel outfit pieces that will help you know to wear this and not that on the airplane.
The number 1 travel outfit idea is to wear one with a Cardigan Not a Poncho - Cardigans add dimension to your travel outfit, they add layering if you get cold, they add length to your body, cardigans can mix and match with your travel outfits while on vacation, cardigans with pockets give you added function in an airport, like a place to store your phone when you have to pay for a coffee. Cardigans can be light weight or heavy for warmth.  Let me know if you agree with all nine  ideas.

What I Wore:
Pink Shell: 
Gray Carpis: 
Yellow Shirt: 
Cardigans: Old
Airplane Mode Shirt: 
Black or Gray Ruffle Tunic: 
My Blue/Gray Halter Tunic: old
Plaid Shirts:  or

349,P_q3BdrFsLI,Singapore Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Singapore.d18...

Small and heavily populated, Singapore is an easy place to explore; nothing in the city is more than an hour from the business district. Thanks to modern construction and outstanding architecture, Singapore is rapidly becoming a powerhouse trade city, but it maintains ties to its Asian roots through traditional temples and many cultural hotspots, like Little India and Kampong Glam. 

Your Singapore tour must include the Botanical Gardens and Orchid Gardens, both beautiful and notable places to visit. If you‚Äôre a fan of exotic animals, stop by the Singapore Zoo and check in with its 300-plus species that take up residence there. You can also take a ‚Äúbumboat‚Äù from Changi Beach to Pulau Ubin, set away from the bustling city, and delight in its quiet mangroves. 

No Singapore sightseeing is complete without a visit to Marina Bay, a glowing, high-tech vision of the future, or Orchard Road, which boasts enough shopping to keep you occupied for several rainy afternoons.

359,qfUE8xQ_SgE,Los Angeles Travel Tips: 13 Things to Know Before You Go to LA,"Things you need to know before you travel to Los Angeles California.  LA is HUGE. You won't be able to see all of LA, unless you're staying for a very very long time. Los Angeles doesn't have a ""center"" and Downtown LA is not very exciting. LA is comprised of multiple cities Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Malibu. Get a rental car - You'll need it to see most tourist attractions in Los Angeles.
2.  Traffic
 - LA has traffic everywhere, all the time.  All day, every day.  Yes, even at 1am on a weekend.  Deal with it.
 - The freeways have names -- it's not I-405 -- it's ""THE 405""
3. Public Transit
 - LA has a subway!
 - But it probably doesn't go where you want!  Especially the beach!
4. Parking
 - Is often Valet
 - and Costs money everywhere
 - Except when you're parking on the freeway :)
 - Pay attention to street signs (confusing times and days)
5. Navigation
 - Know where you're going and take the correct exit
 - Take the wrong exit and you might end up in some place really sketchy
 - Lots of little cities, the street numbering changes in different cities
6. Weather
 - LA is not always sunny and warm
 - It gets cold -- particularly at night
 - Shorts in the day, but pants and a jacket at night
 - And the ocean water is cold too... 70 degrees is as warm as it gets
 - Inland can be 30 degrees warmer than the beach
 - Lots of sunscreen
 - Sunglasses
 - It's dry -- moisturizer
7. LA is unlike the rest of California
 - It can feel like a different country, or at least a different state
 - Venice Beach in particular
8. Hollywood is in the neighborhood called ""Hollywood""
 - West Hollywood is in front of the Hollywood sign (and a different city) with Fancy homes
 - East Hollywood doesn't have much
 - North Hollywood over the mountain is a suburb of LA
 - Oh by the way -- no actors in Hollywood
 - And if you go see a 30 minute sitcom taping it will take 4+ hours
9. The Valley
 - Means San Fernando Valley
 - Burbank, Studio City, North Hollywood, Van Nuys
10. LA's most well known attractions are also some of the most rundown
 - Hollywood Boulevard or is Tijuana?
 - Venice Beach, oh my lord
11. LA is casual
 - Flip flops and shorts are OK except in the most dressy establishments
12. Bring your own shopping bag
 - Supermarkets charge 10 cents for shopping bags in California
13. Mexican Food in LA is awesome
 - Get some fish tacos!
 - And visit King Taco!

Learn some basics about the country, including what you have to do & see once you arrive, when it's best to travel and which food & drinks you definitely need to enjoy throughout your journey.
-----------------------------------------------
Canada is a stunning destination that provides travellers an endless natural playground to get lost in. From the incredible mountain ranges of British Columbia to the coves and cliffs of Canada's East Coast (and everywhere in between), the True North strong and free has it all.

The country is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories, each with their own unique cultural backgrounds, adventurous activities and impressive landscapes. Consider booking a tour that focuses on a specific region so that you can experience it thoroughly - the country is huge, making it unlikely to able to enjoy everything if you rush across the country in a single trip. 

Remember to pack clothes appropriate for the province or territory you‚Äôre visiting. Depending on the season you travel, pack everything from your swimsuit to your parka. 

You can exchange your money into Canadian dollars in any major city, at airports or at the countless ATMs located throughout the country. Credit card and debit transactions are incredibly common, so in most case you will have no trouble using them in lieu of cash. Dining out doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive if you visit the right restaurants, and you'll have to cross off the classics like poutine, sugar pie and craft beer! 

We'd like to thank a few of Canada's incredible tourism boards for allowing use of their travel footage:






‚Äî About Canada ‚Äî
Canada's 10 provinces are Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland & Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. Don't forget the Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut!

Ecuador is one of the most diverse countries in the world though it's comparably tiny. Beside the Galapagos Islands (which is the #1 tourist destination in Ecuador) the country has a lot more to offer, therefore I focussed on ""La Sierra"" in this video which is a paradise for landscape lovers and outdoor adventurers.

Another reason to visit the Andean region is that you have the chance to dive into the local culture and get a real feeling of Ecuador. The places to see in Ecuador I focussed on in this short video are the result of my own travels along the center from north to south and are easily doable in 2 weeks time.

Things to do in Ecuador covered in this video:
01)  - Otavalo market in Otavalo
02)  - Hike the Cuicocha lake
03)  - Middle of the World, Mitad del Mundo & Quitsato in Cayambe
04)  - Quito, capital & UNESCO World Heritage
05)  - Termas de Papallacta (hot springs)
06)  - Cayambe Coca National Park
07)  - Quilotoa & Shalala viewpoint
08)  - Tren Crucero & Nariz del Diablo (Devil's nose)
09)  - Inka ruins in Ingapirca
10)  - Cuenca & it's beautiful old town

We had 3 days in Milan so we hit the ground running and tried to see and do as much as possible. We made time for major attractions like Il Duomo, Sforza Castle, and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, but we also veered away from the crowds in search of street art and interesting neighborhoods. This being Italy, we also tried to prioritize meals, sampling everything from pizza to risotto, and cappuccinos to aperitivos. The following travel guide will highlight 20 things to do when you visit Milan, Italy

1) Milan Catherdral (Il Duomo - Duomo di Milano - Domm de Milan)

Our trip to Milan, Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities, museums, restaurants, arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.

20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:

Our first stop was Il Duomo, which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.

So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.

Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan, and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions, including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.

For some upscale designer shopping, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.

So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.

The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.

Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city‚Äôs canal system.

Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco. 

So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.

And that's all for our visit to Milan. We hope this video will give you some cool ideas of sights and attractions to check out.

This is part of our Travel in Italy series showcasing Italian culture, Italian arts, Italian foods & Italian cuisine.

372,PVEeScXdSVU,Philippines STRANGEST food! ETAG in Sagada | Travel Philippines Vlog,"I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. 
As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!

Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. 

I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. 

I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!

Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? 

Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!? Would you try this?

379,zhtg9XgVwuM,Edinburgh Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The Scottish capital of Edinburgh is one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities. Its Old Town and Royal Mile are filled with the ghosts of medieval merchants, body snatchers, and poets, while its Georgian-styled New Town shines with the glories of the Scottish Enlightenment.  

To see Edinburgh in all her glory, climb to Arthur‚Äôs Seat, the highest of the city‚Äôs seven peaks. Some historians believe this was the site of King Arthur‚Äôs legendary castle Camelot.
 
Nearby, on another volcanic crag, rises Edinburgh Castle, the very symbol of Scotland itself. Over the last eleven centuries, this castle has been laid siege to 26 times but still it stands, a testimony to the indomitable spirit of the Scots.
 
Edinburgh has long held a special place in the hearts of the monarchy. Her Majesty‚Äôs Yacht Britannia sailed over one million miles before being permanently moored at Ocean Terminal as a symbol of the Royal Family‚Äôs affection for the people of Edinburgh.  
 
Edinburgh has been the jewel in the crown of royals for centuries and its old-world chivalry continues today. Thistle Chapel, in St Giles‚Äô Cathedral, honors the Knights and Ladies of Scotland‚Äôs oldest order.
 
In Princes Street Gardens, rises the world‚Äôs largest monument to a writer, dedicated to Sir Walter Scott. At the Writers Museum, learn about more of Scotland‚Äôs cherished literary adventurers. Edinburgh casts her spell over contemporary writers too, JK Rowling wrote two of her Harry Potter series in cozy Old Town nooks, such as the Elephant House Caf√©.
 
For centuries, the University of Edinburgh has given us intellectual giants such as Charles Darwin, David Hume and Alexander Bell. Explore centuries of innovation at the Scottish Museum, or head to South Queensferry to see the Forth Bridge, an engineering marvel when it opened in 1890.

The Royal Botanic Gardens is one of the world‚Äôs oldest and most important centers of botanical science, yet it‚Äôs still a place which invites one to slow down.
 
Edinburgh is a city that has given the world countless gifts, but perhaps her greatest is showing that all parts of the human experience - the sciences and the arts, the past and the present, the sacred and the light-hearted - all have equal value.

Take in the many splendors of the nation‚Äôs capital when you arrive at Washington, D.C.

Your Washington, D.C. tour should start at the National Mall, where you‚Äôll find monuments, memorials, and government buildings instead of tons of shopping. If you‚Äôd like to get around town easily but don‚Äôt want to rent a car, the Capital Bikeshare program will let you cruise around the city without wasting gas or getting stuck in traffic.

Check out the Watergate Hotel and Kennedy Center when you stop at Foggy Bottom, then move on to Georgetown, the oldest district in D.C. It‚Äôs filled with 18th-century buildings and, of course, the university itself. After a stop at the National Cathedral, make your way to the Smithsonian National Zoo, the perfect stop for the young and the young at heart.

If you‚Äôre feeling the need to channel your inner 007, go to the International Spy Museum, and learn about the covert operations and intelligence agencies that have shaped the world we live in. Of course, you can‚Äôt enjoy any Washington, D.C., tourism without admiring the White House, so make sure that‚Äôs on your list too.

383,JUlOLQShi,Egypt Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Egypt.
Egypt is a land of monumental temples, gigantic pyramids, the River Nile and the mysterious Sphinx: 5000 years of history.Founded by Alexander The Great in 332 B.C., the city of Alexandria is located in the Nile Delta and it was here that Caesar and Mark Anthony fell under Cleopatra‚Äôs spell. Cairo is Africa‚Äôs largest city and the heart of the Arab world, extreme poverty living next to opulent wealth, and modern, Western boutiques next to ancient souks. The Cairo Museum is home to the most extensive collection of Egyptian antiquities, including the golden mask and tomb of Tutankamun. Towering above almost any other human achievement are the impressive three pyramids of Gisa. The Cheops Pyramid, the world‚Äôs largest single construction, took four hundred thousand workers twenty years to build. It weighs as much as all the cathedrals in Europe put together and spans an area of 53,000 square metres - the height of a fifty storey skyscraper. In the middle of today‚Äôs modern city of Luxor, known as the ‚ÄòCapital City Of The Pharaohs‚Äô, the Luxor Temple stretches along the eastern banks of the Nile and, not far away, the temple complex of Karnak and the Amun Temple. 67 kilometres from Luxor, on the western bank of the Nile, lies the Temple Of Dendera, the most important place of worship for the love goddess, HATHOR, whose heavenly appearance was portrayed by the body of a cow. At Aswan, the landscape of the Nile is enchanting, but it is the stone temples of Abu Simbel that take one back to ancient Egypt, land of the Pharaohs, and archaeological paradise.

384,Oo6iAxf4si0,San Francisco Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/San-Francisco....

Leave the regular world behind when you step into the fog-swathed ‚ÄúCity by the Bay.‚Äù From shopping adventures in Union Square to a trip on the city‚Äôs legendary cable cars, a trip to San Francisco is bound to leave you with incredible memories.

Stop by Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf and indulge in its shops and galleries, as well as some of the best fresh seafood you‚Äôll ever taste. Walk on the Golden Gate Bridge and take in the fresh sea air and views of the bay and Pacific Ocean. If it‚Äôs a more serene environment you‚Äôre after, pass through the stately architecture and flowing lagoon of the Palace of Fine Arts. 

Of course, San Francisco sightseeing isn‚Äôt complete without an excursion to Alcatraz, the island prison that once held some of the country‚Äôs most notorious criminals. Look into its empty cells and thick stone walls and wonder, could you escape ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù?

Visit our San Francisco travel guide to plan your Bay Area trip.

390,2cLKw9k,Montreal Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Welcome to Montreal, Canada. This extraordinary city, which began life as a French colony in the 1600s, is now a stunning metropolis combining old-world architecture with modern dashes.

When Mark Twain visited Montreal in the 19th century, he was so taken by its many churches that he nicknamed it ‚ÄúThe City of 100 Bell Towers.‚Äù These numerous buildings are often part of Montreal sightseeing; marvel at the imposing stone fa√ßade of Christ Church Cathedral, or stand beneath the great arched ceiling of the beautiful Notre Dame Basilica. You can spend days exploring the city‚Äôs many sacred spaces, but Montreal tourism is so much more than that; if you‚Äôre a foodie, you‚Äôre in luck, because the residents of Montreal adore a good meal, whether it‚Äôs poutine from a streetside bistro or fresh produce from the farmers market. 

A tour of Montreal will take you across cobblestone streets and through architecture that dates back to the 1600s, but one thing you must remember to do is to walk and play in its numerous green spaces. The city‚Äôs inhabitants take great pride in Montreal‚Äôs natural beauty, and hikes up Mont Royal or along the St. Lawrence River are frequent activities for locals. Remember to bring your camera, as the riverfront and the mountain are full of striking photo opportunities. 
 
What is your favorite part of Montreal?

20 Things to do in Krak√≥w, Poland Travel Guide video transcript:

We kicked off this trip to Poland with a visit to Krakow, a city people have been telling us to visit for years and now we know why. Krakow in the summertime was wonderful! We spent our time enjoying castle views from the river side, exploring neighbourhoods covered in street art, eating some of the best pierogie of our lives, and also discovering what we think may be the best ice cream. The following is our travel guide to some of the best things to do in Krakow!

Wawel Castle is Krakow's crowning jewel, and for centuries it was the residence of the kings of Poland. You can see a mix of Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque architecture all in one place. 

While in the city, we also had to walk the Royal Route, which was once the historic coronation path of Polish kings.

After visiting the basilica, we spent a bit of time walking the Main Square, which just so happens to be Europe's largest medieval town square.

And that‚Äôs it for our visit to Krakow! We hope this video gave you a few ideas of things to do around the city. If you have any other places to add to this list or any tips for fellow travellers visiting Krakow feel free to share those.

This is part of our Travel in Poland video series showcasing Polish food, Polish culture, Polish cuisine while visiting Krak√≥w Polska.

Especially if  it is your first time visiting London, if you aren't careful you can end up paying a lot more for your travel so it's important you pay the right fare. You can use your oyster card or contactless payment card for lots of different types of transport on London TFL services. This includes buses, trains, tubes, Thames Clipper boats, trams and even the Emirates Airline cable cars. 
My favourite thing to do is to travel on the old Number 15 routemaster buses. A real icon of London. I'll show you all the tips and tricks on how to behave like a true Londoner and not to be barged out of the way by the locals when travelling on transport in London. 
There are other ways to pay for London Transport including Apple Pay on your iphone or with a contactless credit or debit card. But I think it's easiest to get an oyster card when you first arrive. Try to avoid buying paper tickets because they cost more!! And the buses don't accept money so you must have an oyster or credit card or apple pay.

426,idg6vW3vXtE,Prague Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Prague.d18001...

Step into a child‚Äôs storybook when you first arrive in Prague, a city in the Czech Republic where sleek, modern buildings share space with ancient gothic architecture. Wander down the twisting cobblestone streets ‚Äì you‚Äôre sure to find something new and exciting. After all, even locals get lost here.

Prague tourism usually involves the Royal Route, a historic coronation path that will take you through Old Town. Walk a few blocks to Old Town Square and sample local street fare in the shadow of old castles and palaces. Old Town itself is full of cafes, restaurants, and galleries, and will provide days of exploration for intrepid visitors.

Cross over the Charles Bridge and climb up to Prague Castle, a network of palaces, churches, and numerous museums. Be careful, as folks were a lot shorter back then ‚Äì you may have to duck your head as you walk through the low-ceilinged, artifact-filled halls.

Your Prague sightseeing must pause at St. Vitus Cathedral, a massive gothic structure dating back 600 years. You‚Äôll have to arch your back to see over 300 feet to the ceilings, which seem to vanish into the heavens. By the time you‚Äôre back outside, it will likely be twilight. You‚Äôll see pigs roasting on spits and people gathered under the statue of St. Wenceslas to share their daily adventures. The people here are friendly, so why not join them and chime in with your own stories?

Have you been to Prague? What would you like to do while there?

429,ndxssbwwGZU,SCARIEST Bridges And Roads You Can Travel On,"Roads and bridges are things that are used to travel more efficiently from place to place. They certainly help when it comes to crossing water or great heights between mountains, although those same traits also make these passages absolutely terrifying. These are the Scariest Bridges And Roads You Can Travel On. We wouldn‚Äôt recommend going to any of them. Just trust us. 

Subscribe to Talltanic 

#8 - Zhangjiajie Glass Walk Bridge
Just a year ago, China opened a breathtaking glass skywalk that had been added to Hunan‚Äôs mountainous landscapes. The winding bridge is 1,410 feet long and, as you can see from these frightening photos, it hovers 984 feet above the ground. This would be the very last place in the world you would find us. You‚Äôre on your own if you want to go check this scary bridge out. 

#7 - Lake Pontchartrain Causeway
You might be able to guess why the bridge in this picture made it into this video just by looking at it. It‚Äôs not particularly high, and it actually only sits 16 feet above the water. The bridge connects the two Louisiana towns of Metairie and Mandeville. It stretches an incredible 24 miles across the lake. If that wasn‚Äôt scary enough, once you get about eight miles into the bridge, you no longer have a visual of land. 

#6 - Captain William Moore Bridge 
Although the bridge in this photo isn‚Äôt all that scary to look at, once you find out about the surroundings and the structural integrity of this bridge, you might just change your mind. This bridge is located in Alaska and it crosses over an ACTIVE earthquake fault. The engineers who designed the bridge planned for the potential disaster and only anchored one end of the bridge securely. Now, when the ground trembles and shifts, the bridge won‚Äôt just be torn apart. However, we want to know how it‚Äôs still safe with only one end secured. How does that work?


#5 - Millau Viaduct, France
The bridge in this picture gives us the same thrilling fear as riding a roller coaster. The bridge pictured here is the Millau Viaduct located in France. The tallest part of the bridge, from the valley floor to tip of the mast is 1,125 feet tall, which is taller than the Eiffel Tower! It may be less than two miles in length, but this is another path we just aren‚Äôt going to bother taking. 

#4 - The Confederation Bridge 
This bridge located in Canada made it into this video not because it is incredibly tall and you‚Äôre scared of heights, but because it is a long eight miles to the other side. You can see just how long it is in this picture. While that in itself doesn‚Äôt seem to shiver worthy, the fact that it is the longest bridge crossing over ice cold water in the world, does. Yes, there are ones that are miles longer, but supposedly not over such freezing waters. This one billion dollar bridge probably won‚Äôt just dump you in the water as it crumbles, but that fear factor that it will is still alive and well. 


#3 - Hussaini Hanging Bridge
Hanging bridge is right! Though it should really be called ‚Äúhanging by a thread bridge,‚Äù just look at the mess in this picture, someone come collect their granny, she needs help! This rickety cable and wood bridge is located in Pakistan, and you couldn‚Äôt pay us enough to cross it. The bridge crosses over the rapidly flowing Hunza River and the tattered and worn remains of the previous bridges hang right next to the one being currently used. To make this bridge that much more unbearable, it was swallowed up by flood waters in 2010. Although there has been a newer one built, it doesn't seem any safer. 


#2 - Monkey Bridges
If you told us that we would have to walk across the scary skinny bridge pictured here, we would have laughed into next week. There‚Äôs just no way. Even though this bridge seems like a joke in a movie, these ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù bridges are used as a quick passage in several parts of Vietnam. The name ‚ÄúMonkey‚Äù bridge comes from the stooped posture you have to adopt when crossing. Just so you know how crazy this bridge is, it is exactly as it looks in the picture; the bridge is made from a single bamboo log with one or two handrails. If you think crossing this is a good idea, best of luck to you and we‚Äôll see you down at the bottom of the river, since you‚Äôre certainly falling in. 


#1 - Eshima Ohashi Bridge
This terrifying bridge wasn‚Äôt a nightmare constructed by an architect but if you looked at this picture of the bridge, you would think it was. This mile long bridge spans across Lake Nakaumi and links the city of Matsue to the city of Sakaiminato. The reason for the sudden climb in the bridge is meant to allow entire barges or ships underneath without incident. Although this bridge looks absolutely terrifying at about a 45-degree angle, it is actually not that steep, and a side view of the bridge shows that the highest point is reached with a gradual incline. It‚Äôs not at all how it appears.",travel

The Panama Canal is a 77.1-kilometre (48 mi) ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean (via the Caribbean Sea) to the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal, 26 metres (85 ft) above sea level. The current locks are 33.5 metres (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks is currently under construction and is due to open in 2016.

France began work on the canal in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease. The United States took over the project in 1904, and took a decade to complete the canal, which was officially opened on August 15, 1914. One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduced the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage or Strait of Magellan. The shorter, faster, and safer route to the U.S. West Coast and to nations in and around the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy. It takes between 20 and 30 hours to traverse the canal.

During construction, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the 1977 Torrijos‚ÄìCarter Treaties provided for handover to Panama. After a period of joint American‚ÄìPanamanian control, the canal was taken over by the Panamanian government in 1999, and is now managed and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a Panamanian government agency.

Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2008, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax. The American Society of Civil Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world.",travel

Our visit Lisbon travel guide covers some of the top attractions including the best in arts, entertainment, museums, nightlife and restaurants. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't find in your typical tourism brochure or Lisbon city guide.

20 things to do in Lisbon, Portugal | Top Attractions Travel Guide:

Our first stop of the day was Sao Jorge Castle, which is an old Moorish fortification that sits on a hill overlooking Lisbon and the Tagus River. You can get some nice panoramic views of the city from here, and they also have peacocks roaming the grounds.

Miradouro das Portas do Sol is one of the many look out points in Lisbon that offers postcard-perfect views of the city. This particular terrace overlooks the Alfama district and it is always popular with tourists.

Carmo is a mediaeval convent that was ruined during the 1755 earthquake, and today it is used as an archaeological museum.  It's a strange feeling walking down the ruined nave of the church and seeing blue skies above your head, but that's exactly what makes it worth a visit. 

Another place to visit is Belem Tower. The tower was built on the banks of the Tagus River, and it was meant to act as both a defense system and a ceremonial gateway into Lisbon.

The Jeronimos Monastery is one of the most visited sights in Lisbon. It's one of the best examples of Late Gothic Manueline architecture, so have a close look at the intricate detailing when you visit. 

A fun way to get around Lisbon's hilly streets is by riding the trams. There are different lines across the city, but #28 is the most popular one with visitors.

The Santa Justa lift is an elevator that connects the lower streets of Baixa with Carmo Square, and it is the only remaining vertical elevator in Lisbon. Though it is meant to serve a functional role, it is also quite popular with visitors who find the elevator a novel idea. 

And that's a wrap for our week in the Portuguese capital! We hope you enjoyed this video and that it gave you some ideas of things to do in Lisbon. As always, if you have any other suggestion for travellers of places to visit and things to do around town, feel free to share them in the comments below. Wishing you happy travels!

Barcelona is the capital of Catolonia and the second largest city in Spain. Barcelona is today one of the world's leading tourist, economic, trade fair/exhibitions and cultural-sports centres, and its influence in commerce, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of theworld's major global cities. 
The most important places to visit in Barcelona are: La Sagrada Familia (This was the largest project by Antoni Gaudi. The construction of this world famous church began in 1882 and is still ongoing), Casa Mila (also known as La Pedrera, it was architected by the great Antoni Gaudi.

439,F2sepCUnENg,Buenos Aires Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"http://www.expedia.com/Buenos-Aires.d...

Named for good sailing winds, Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina, and home to nearly a quarter of the country‚Äôs two million residents. Come for the stunning European architecture, and stay for delicious cuts of meat, the city‚Äôs zest for soccer, and, of course, the tango. 

‚ÄúThe Paris of South America‚Äù boasts outstanding shopping and a friendly populace. A tour of Buenos Aires should cut through La Boca Harbor, where you‚Äôll find numerous street vendors, restaurants, and street dancers willing to give you a spin. Wander down the streets to take in colorful artwork, and make a game out of asking the locals what neighborhood you should tour next. Here‚Äôs a hint: with so much to see, everyone will give you a different answer!

Some will tell you to visit San Telmo for souvenirs, patio shopping, and crumbling historical buildings. Others will suggest Puerto Madero, a refurbished shipping port that boasts a mixture of old-world glamour and modern buildings. What everyone will suggest, however, is a stop by Plaza de Mayo. There you can take in the rosy architecture of the Casa Rosada, which was made famous by Argentine First Lady Eva Peron and the musical about her life, ‚ÄúEvita.‚Äù Take a tour and learn about her life, from her humble beginnings to her rise to power.

Cap off your Buenos Aires sightseeing with an evening walk through Puerto Madero, where you can get a late dinner and dance until the next day arrives.

What do you want to see in Buenos Aires?

441,xycecbwpIzE,Travelling With a Physical Disability in Japan,"Part 2: Living in Japan with a Physical Disability https://youtu.be/xycecbwpIzE

Many people are aware that Japan has excellent public transportation. If you're a keen observer, you may have noticed the many wheelchair accessible facilities, but perhaps have not seen physically disabled people make use of them. In this video, Yuriko Oda (Wheelchair Walker) and Josh Grisdale (Accessible Japan) show what it's like to travel with a physical disability in Japan's trains, buses, cars, taxis, and planes. 

This is part of new series of social documentaries about Japan that I'm making. Future episodes will attempt to answer questions like: what are the living conditions of the homeless, what does social housing look life and how affordable is housing, what is it like to work in Japan and is there any work/life balance, and what is it like to go to primary school?

If you'd like to support these types of social documentaries, I now have a Patreon account . Any support at all will be greatly appreciated!

Both Yuriko and Josh post great information about accessibility in Japan, and you can find them at:

24 Hours in London Travel Guide Video Transcript:

London. Like many world capitals, this is a city that never sleeps, and on my most recent visit, I got to experience that firsthand. My challenge was to discover 24 unique experiences in London ‚Äì one for every hour of the day! 

From secret speakeasies to living room concerts, and whimsical afternoon teas to bustling food markets, I scoured the city to bring you the following 24 hours in London! Let‚Äôs begin. 

I skipped breakfast to visit a coffee shop in Hampstead!

With a bit of caffeine in my system, I continued on to my 9:00 am activity which was walking up Parliament Hill in Hampstead Heath with a great lookout point of the city skyline. 

Set in a former power station it is home to the national collection of British art from 1900 to the present.

I got off at Westminster Station and walked over to Horse Guards Parade for my next activity. 

If you‚Äôre visiting with kids there‚Äôs a section inside the museum where you can try on different uniforms.

Cruising down the Thames is a classic way to experience London while hearing interesting London facts that you won‚Äôt find in any guidebook.

With hundreds of food stalls selling everything.

What can you do in the middle of the afternoon in London? I made my way over to the West End for a show.

Having afternoon tea at the Sanderson was like stumbling down a rabbit hole and being transported to the world of Alice in Wonderland. Everything from the menu to the teapots to the ‚Äòdrink me‚Äô potions was just right!

The RISEGallery has been doing a lot of work to help connect local artists with property owners, and this has resulted in some beautiful murals. 

I attended my first Late where museums and art galleries stay open after hours, offering extended admission or putting on special events.

I got to experience Sofar Sounds, which is a pop-up concert that takes place in people‚Äôs living rooms. It‚Äôs not until 24 hours before the event that you are emailed the address and the names of the artists performing that night. 

Then at 11pm, for a bit of live music, it was onwards to The Blues Kitchen in Brixton, where they do barbecue, bourbon, and blues.

Flight Club is a bar that puts a twist on the traditional English pub by adding modern darts into the equation.

With the clock striking one, my next stop transported me to London in the 1940s. 

This bar was set in an attic and it had a bit of speakeasy vibe. There mixing all sorts of fun cocktails.

We checked out London‚Äôs nightlife scene at 3 am with dance moves at KOKO.

Last but not least, the final activity of my 24 hours in London was breakfast at Duck & Waffle. Located on a 40th floor, this restaurant has amazing views of Central London and they are open 24 hours a day. 

And that‚Äôs a wrap for my 24 hours in London! I hope you enjoyed following along and that also got a few ideas for your own trip. As you can see, this city has plenty to offer, no matter the time of day. Wishing you happy travels and see you next time!

460,ln5qqJTqm0,"Netherlands Summary Travel Video ‚Äì Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden, Delft, Rotterdam, Haarlem, Holland","Taking you on a grand journey through the Netherlands, starting with a visit to Haarlem, travelling then down to Leiden, spending three nights in Leiden, doing a few day trips out from there. Then I‚Äôll take you to Delft for three more nights and excursions out from Delft such as to The Hague  which is the political capital of the nation.

And then on to Rotterdam the great modern city of the Netherlands, continuing to Utrecht, a university town with a very large historic center and then down to Maastricht in the southern part of the country.  I'll also be going up to the Alkmaar cheese market which is a lot of fun. It happens once a week and it‚Äôs a big touristic event. They re-create what it was like in the old days with the cheese market and the guys running around carrying her sleds full of giant Gouda cheeses, but here in the Netherlands they don't say Gouda, it's 'Howda.' I'll take you to that town of Gouda as well and show you where they make the cheese. 
And then up to Amsterdam for the grand finale.
I‚Äôm staying two nights or three nights in place, in Amsterdam six nights, so I‚Äôll be providing quite thorough coverage showing you the shopping streets and the museums, the old historic neighborhoods, the old brick buildings and going on some canal boat rides as well ‚Äì  that‚Äôs one of the real fun things to do when you‚Äôre in the Netherlands.
In each of the towns I‚Äôll be walking because these towns are compact and historic and have so many things to see while walking around.  And occasionally you can hop on a tram or hop on a bus and that helps you get along. Maybe you want to rent a bicycle. Everybody here is on bicycles.
The Netherlands is a land of canals and bicycles and beautifully and preserved old towns such as Delft and Leiden seem like the architecture hasn‚Äôt changed in the last 300 years.
And it‚Äôs really quite a revelation to see how modern everything is at the same time 
The people of course are highly educated. They have some of the top universities in the world in the Netherlands, and the higher education is all but free for those who are interested.
And it‚Äôs just a nation of friendly people, smart people, very productive people as well. Fortunately for us, just about all of them speak very good English, so it‚Äôs very easy to get by when you are visiting here.
I‚Äôll be spending three weeks traveling by train, and the Netherlands has got perhaps the best  train system in Europe. Yes maybe even better Switzerland. It‚Äôs phenomenal. The trains are clean, fast, frequent.
The foods are great. You can have a reasonable lunch for about ‚Ç¨12, say the equivalent of no more than $15 ‚Äì often it‚Äôs a good hearty sandwich and a cappuccino or a beer. Of course the Dutch love their beer.
And they also drink a lot of wine as well. They don‚Äôt produce wine, but being in Europe, in the center of Europe, it is very easy for them to bring in wines from not just France and Italy and Spain but all over the world actually. You see always a good variety on menus, but especially it's the beer. 
They must have dozens of varieties of beer that are brewed right here in the Netherlands.
Now people also call this country Holland and that‚Äôs a common mistake actually because Holland is just part of the Netherlands. It's two provinces on the Western side but the country actually the Netherlands. And  the people are Dutch,  they speak Dutch. It‚Äôs a unique language. It‚Äôs a separate language but has similarities to German and to Danish.
I‚Äôm traveling in the in the month of September which is a good time to be here, and I got real lucky with the weather so far, it has been perfect. It‚Äôs been let‚Äôs say 75¬∞F 20¬∞ 22¬∞C, just very comfortable and actually a bit warmer that should be at this time of year and that‚Äôs a good thing, sometimes you get lucky.
So it‚Äôs a real excursion through the Netherlands, not just visiting Amsterdam.
Even if you are only going to Amsterdam you should spend 4 to 5 days there so you can do some day trips because the country is pretty small and you can travel all way to the Hague for example by train in about 45 minutes from Amsterdam, so it could be a home base for you.
Traveling for three weeks in this wonderful country was a great experience, including all the way down to Maastricht at the southern tip of the Netherlands, and a little side trip over to Aachen in Germany to see the Cathedral dating back to the year 800. 
You're going to love this upcoming series of movies about the Netherlands. 
We will focus on Amsterdam, of course. I spent a week in this wonderful city. We will have pictures of the museums, the restaurants, the canals, the streets, the old buildings, Rembrandt's house ‚Äì and yes it took a lot of walking to get these shots. It was three weeks on foot.
The Netherlands presents the visitor with the wonderful variety of sights to see. You're going to love this upcoming series of movies about the Netherlands.",travel

‚òÜ Always select ""Government Rate"" when booking hotels (EVERY hotel we have ever stayed at has offered one)
‚òÜ Checked baggage is almost always FREE with your military ID (we save a lot this way and still get to pack extras)

466,_TKIM1vUE,Manchester Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"Manchester is a city of firsts. It was the epicenter of the Industrial Revolution, the place where mankind first split the atom, and the birthplace of the modern computer.
 
The many chapters of Manchester‚Äôs story come together in Castlefield. Here you‚Äôll find the remains of a Roman fort, Bridgewater Canal, and some of the mills which once generated incredible wealth for the city. In the background, Beetham Tower is a symbol of a city again on the rise.
 
Manchester‚Äôs crowning glory is its Town Hall, built to rival the great buildings of London. During the Industrial Revolution, Manchester‚Äôs merchants went on a spending spree, scouring the world in search of cultural treasures to fill their stately homes. Many of these treasures now reside in the Manchester Art Gallery and the Manchester Museum.
 
In 1653, the Chetham Library became the country‚Äôs first free public library and has been open to all ever since. Two hundred and fifty years later, one of the city‚Äôs greatest philanthropists, Enriqueta Rylands, unveiled the John Rylands Library, dedicated to the memory of her textile magnate husband.
 
Housed in a restored Edwardian pump house is The People‚Äôs History Museum, which celebrates those who challenged Britain‚Äôs rigid political and class systems. At the world‚Äôs oldest surviving railway station, you‚Äôll find The Museum of Science and Industry, while the Imperial War Museum North reminds us of the human cost of warfare.
 
Explore the city‚Äôs musical heritage in the Northern Quarter, and check out Canal Street, which perfectly encapsulates the Mancunian ideals of tolerance and good times. Learn more about the city‚Äôs footballing history at the National Football Museum, or time your visit for a match at Old Trafford.

Solution to bonus riddle: 

Your professor has accidentally stepped through a time portal in his physics lab. You‚Äôve got just a minute to jump through before it closes and leaves him stranded in history.

Can you take the right amount of nodules to get back to the present before the portal closes? Dan Finkel shows how.

Boeing patented cuddle seats for more comfortable air travel. Lets talk about that. 

Most people do not really enjoy air travel. The most annoying part of air travel is to sleep in an upright position, unless you are pretty rich. 

This week Boeing has solved the problem with cuddle chairs.

A passenger picks up a backpack under the seat. He opens the straps and secures them to mating buckles near the head rest of the seat.  Then he unfolds the head cushion from the backpack. The head cushion has a face relief aperture to receive the face of the passenger. And the chest cushion receives the passenger's chest in a forward leaning position.

Might get too comfy though. OOps.

Patent Information:
Patent number: US 8,985,693
Title: Transport vehicle upright sleep support system 
Inventors: Purpura; William J. (Anaheim, CA), Purpura; Paula K. (Anaheim, CA)
Assignee: The Boeing Company (Chicago, IL) 
Appl. No.: 13/973,118
Filed: August 22, 2013

Abstract
An upright sleep support system incorporates a head cushion having a face relief aperture to receive the eyes, nose, mouth and chin of a passenger placing his or her face against the head cushion with a hinged support structure for angular adjustment, sleeves that open in front to support the passengers arms, and a chest cushion on the back of the device. The chest cushion receives the passenger's chest in a forward leaning position. The head cushion is deployable from a backpack and the chest cushion is integrated into the back of the backpack.",travel

Bangkok, Thailand
The Asian city of Bangkok is situated in central Thailand and is home to over 8 million people.

Judged on criteria like culture, cuisine, shopping and value for money, Bangkok repeatedly wins the highest travel accolades.

Climb aboard a long-tail boat to experience the city from its waterways. Hop off at one of the many temples which line the river, such as Wat Pho, the home of the reclining Buddha.

Thai cuisine is renowned the world over. There are over 50 000 places to eat in Bangkok, with some of the best offerings dished up by street vendors.

While some come to eat, others come to shop. From fabrics to spices, handicrafts to designer brands, Bangkok is heaven for bargain hunters.

Thai nightlife is legendary. For a great night out head to Khao San Road, a major backpackers and entertainment hub.

Just to the city's north lays the ancient capital Ayutthaya, while to the south the resort town of Pattaya lights up nightly.

Bangkok is just a short flight away from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.

Bon Matin! 

It‚Äôs our first morning in lovely Paris, and we‚Äôve just had breakfast. I had an omelette, and it was really really delicious.

We are now on our way to Notre Dame, but lots to see and do, very excited, and I‚Äôll keep you posted throughout the day!

See ya later!!

Hello, me again! Some back stage exclusives, just been interviewing a guy called Tibaut, at the restaurant we ate at last night. Just got some questions around this kinda food, and what makes France and particularly Paris food so amazing. 
Really good, we‚Äôre actually going to break for lunch ourselves now, so stay tuned and I‚Äôll keep you posted a bit later on!

Bye!

So we‚Äôve just done some various shots along the Champs-Elys√©es, and Arc De Triomphe. Now on a bridge on our way to the Louvre, a very lovely bridge actually, that‚Äôs what I like about France everything is so opulent, even their lampposts are really swish! Check this out‚Ä¶ 
And yeah! On our way to the Louvre. 

See ya later!!

Ok, so I‚Äôm now on the bank of the River Seine, just did a quick French tutorial with a couple of guys from Discover Walks. They‚Äôre a company based here in France. They do really really good tour guides, Tom walked me from the Louvre, through the gardens... I can‚Äôt pronounce it! Jardin de Tuileries?!
Basically means, and roughly translated to, tile gardens because there used to be a tile factory there.

Learnt some insider tips about the Louvre: don‚Äôt go to the tourist entrance because that‚Äôs for chumps, apparently! Go like the locals and use one of the many other ones that are lying around!

The weather is glorious! So I'm gunna walk to the Eiffel Tower! See ya soon!",travel

In this he is alternately aided and hampered by the Lilliputian town crier and general fussbudget, Gabby. A life-threatening situation develops when the bumbling trio of Blefiscu spies, Sneak, Snoop, and Snitch, manage to steal Gulliver's pistol.

Max Fleischer's animated feature-length classic of Gulliver's adventures in Lilliput was the first full-length animated childrens cartoon after Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

Lyrics:

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

I'm traveling light, it's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light, like we used to do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Good night, good night, my fallen star
I guess you're right, you always are
I know you're right about the blues
You live some life you'd never choose
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who
Forgot to dream of the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light, like we used to do

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

Traveling light, it's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light' like we used to do

But if the road leads back to you
Must I forget the things I knew
When I was friends with one or two
Traveling light like we used to do
I'm traveling light

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Many suspected this after seeing set photos leak. However, after doing some research, I want to propose the theory that Avengers 4 Endgame is NOT actually about time travel in the normal sense as we believe. Instead, there have been some interesting connections that the Russo Brothers have been building up between tony stark and Thanos ever since Captain America Civil War. Check out this unique theory to find out what Avengers Endgame may actually be about and the ""REAL"" solution to defeating thanos.

BUY THE MOVIE: http://amzn.to/v8NL0H
Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: 

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A director (Joel McCrea) of escapist films goes on the road as a hobo to learn about life and gets a rude awakening.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In Preston Sturges' classic comedy of Depression-era America, filmmaker John L. Sullivan (Joel McCrea), fed up with directing profitable comedies like ""Ants in Your Plants of 1939,"" is consumed with the desire to make a serious social statement in his upcoming film, ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Unable to function in the rarefied atmosphere of Hollywood, Sullivan decides to hit the road, disguised as a tramp, and touch base with the ""real"" people of America. But Sullivan's studio transforms his odyssey into a publicity stunt, providing the would-be nomad with a luxury van, complete with butler (Robert Greig) and valet (Eric Blore). Advised by his servants that the poor resent having the rich intrude upon them, Sullivan escapes his retinue and continues his travels incognito. En route, he meets a down-and-out failed actress (Veronica Lake). Experiencing firsthand the scroungy existence of real-life hoboes, Sullivan returns to Hollywood full of bleeding-heart fervor. After first arranging for the girl's screen test, he heads for the railyards, intending to improve the lot of the local rail-riders and bindlestiffs by handing out ten thousand dollars in five-dollar bills. Instead, Sullivan is coldcocked by a tramp, who steals Sullivan's clothes and identification. When the tramp is run over by a speeding train, the world at large is convinced that the great John L. Sullivan is dead. Meanwhile, the dazed Sullivan, dressed like a bum with no identification on his person, is arrested and put to work on a brutal Southern chain gang. With its almost Shakespearean combination of uproarious comedy and grim tragedy, Sullivan's Travels is Sturges' masterpiece and one of the finest movies about movies ever made.
