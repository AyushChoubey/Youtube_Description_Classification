Along with this question, you probably want to find out whether your skills are appropriate for this field, what steps you need to take to become a successful data scientist, and if your background will affect the chances of becoming a data scientist. All valid questions!

So, to help you answer your questions, we examined 1,001 linked LinkedIn resumes of people who are currently working as data scientists to see where exactly they come from and what skills they’re using in their day-to-day activities.
 
The main messages we extracted from our study both last and this year, is that if you have the skill base that makes a data scientist, you can be a data scientist. It will be interesting to see how the data science profession changes in the next 2-5 years, but right now, a universal data scientist profile appears to be taking shape: a unique programming language toolbox desired across industries and locations; preferably a Master’s degree, or a Bachelor’s and proof of practical abilities; and a confident learning-on-the-go attitude are the currencies of the field.

33,GE0OA,Hadley Wickham – “You can't do data science in a GUI”,"Hadley Wickham is Chief Scientist at RStudio, a member of the R Foundation, and Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland. He builds tools (both computational and cognitive) to make data science easier, faster, and more fun. His work includes packages for data science (the tidyverse: including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, purrr, and readr) and principled software development (roxygen2, testthat, devtools). 

In his ACM Chicago local chapter talk, Wickham discusses four essential tenets of his work:

1) Data science requires programming; a GUI does not provide the power necessary to tackle the creative challenges that data science requires.

2) There are huge advantages to code, particularly when you see it as a medium of communication.

3) R is a terrific environment for writing data analysis code. It has some quirky features as a programming language, but many of the quirks are well tailored to the problems of data science.

4) Code should be primary artefact of any analysis, but you might generate the code in ways apart from typing it on a keyboard.",Science and Technology

36,-AkBfBWr_G,Can You Become a Data Scientist?,"So, you want to become a data scientist? Good idea! Data science is a super-hot topic and the data scientist is one of the most illustrious jobs of the 21st century. But how does one actually become a data scientist?

You can ask around, read Quora answers, or talk to someone in the industry, sure, these methods will supply you with information, but there’s no doubt that this information will be biased towards someone else’s personal experience. How others became data scientists is of little importance to you, I bet. What you’re interested in is whether YOU can become one. Are your skills appropriate for this field? What steps do you need to take to become a successful data scientist? Will your background affect the chances of becoming a data scientist? All valid questions.

So, let’s not talk about how we at 365 data science became data scientists, instead, let’s approach things a little differently:

If you want to become a data scientist, you should answer questions like one.

A data scientist wouldn’t take the experience and background of just one or two other data scientists and accept them as a quintessential guide. So, how much data would be statistically adequate to give us an idea of what it takes to become a data scientist? 100 profiles? 500? How about 1,001? Well, that’s exactly what we did.

40,RfK3D5dJV2Q,Turing Lecture: Data Science for Medicine,"Medicine 2.0: Using Machine Learning to Transform Medical Practice and Discovery

In this talk, Mihaela will present her view of the transformation of medicine through the use of machine learning, and some of her own contributions.  This transformation is already being felt in every aspect of medicine: from clinical support for personalized diagnosis and prognosis to the estimation of individualized treatment effects without the need for clinical trials to medical discovery to the entire path of patient care. The heart of this transformation is the intelligent use of existing data.

Because of the unique and complex characteristics of medical data and medical questions, many familiar methods are inadequate.  Mihaela’s work develops novel machine learning methods and applies them to a wide variety of medical settings. This work achieves enormous improvements over current clinical practice and over existing machine learning methods. 

This talk will explore some of Mihaela’s work and vision of how data science can transform medical discovery and care.

Introduction to Data Science

The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do, this field is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science practitioners and we will get an overview of what data science is today.

// What is Climate Change?
Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years). Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions or in the time variation of weather around longer-term average conditions (i.e., more or fewer extreme weather events). 

Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as global warming.

Scientists actively work to understand past and future climate by using observations and theoretical models. A climate record—extending deep into the Earth's past—has been assembled, and continues to be built up, based on geological evidence from borehole temperature profiles, cores removed from deep accumulations of ice, floral and faunal records, glacial and periglacial processes, stable-isotope and other analyses of sediment layers, and records of past sea levels. More recent data are provided by the instrumental record. General circulation models, based on the physical sciences, are often used in theoretical approaches to match past climate data, make future projections, and link causes and effects in climate change.",Science and Technology

In fact, the amount of digital data that exists is growing at a rapid rate, doubling every two years, and changing the way we live. According to IBM, 2.5 billion gigabytes (GB) of data was generated every day in 2012.

An article by Forbes states that Data is growing faster than ever before and by the year 2020, about 1.7 megabytes of new information will be created every second for every human being on the planet.

Which makes it extremely important to at least know the basics of the field. After all, here is where our future lies.

In this video, we will differentiate between the Data Science, Big Data, and Data Analytics, based on what it is, where it is used, the skills you need to become a professional in the field, and the salary prospects in each field.

If this sounds familiar, you may have missed the increasing popularity of Linux containers in the DevOps world, in particular Docker. Michelangelo D’Agostino demonstrates Docker’s many benefits, from making data science code and environments more portable and shareable to making the transition from development to production more seamless to giving data scientists a common basis for collaborating with software engineers, and explains why Docker deserves a place in every data scientist’s toolkit.

Drawing on several successfully executed case studies from Civis Analytics, Michelangelo offers an introduction to Docker and DockerHub and explores the tools, techniques, and workflows most applicable to data science. While much of the literature around containers is geared towards DevOps and software engineers, Michelangelo discusses using Docker for Python and R development, for training and scoring predictive models, and for deploying data science dashboards and web apps. Michelangelo also shows how Docker can be used as a collaboration tool and bridge between data scientists and software engineers.

ABOUT THE TALK

Spatial data science uses many of the same techniques and algorithms as traditional data science, but the spatial component can add a large amount of additional information by combining with other sources at the same location (e.g., census, geolocated tweets), using realtime routing services, or even by using the spatial structure of the distribution of the data.

In this talk, I will present lessons learned on extracting more information from spatial data than is typically used in data science projects. I will do this by highlighting two tools we recently used for client projects (spatially-constrained clustering, probabilistic principal component analysis), and present about the structure of spatial data in general that can be readily added to models.

Why learn Python?

Programmers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. 
Python has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next ""Big Thing"" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.

https://acadgild.com/big-data/data-an...
To learn how data scientists are different from data analysts just takes – seconds/minutes. So, let’s get started. 
First up, they’re not entirely different. Both careers are in demand and pay well. The average data analyst earns $ 65,470, while the average data scientist makes $ 120,931. 
The difference in salaries, however, indicates a difference in the skill sets of these professionals. Data scientists are advanced data analysts. They possess additional skills that allow them to do more with data.  
Data analysts generally access known data from a single source like a CRM to solve a given set of business problems. 
These problems are usually customer or user-centric. 
Data analysts aim to uncover new insights from known data that can help them resolve the chosen problems. 
They manage data on programs like Excel. 
They use SQL to raise queries and find the solutions they are looking for. 
 
Much of their work revolves around scanning existing data to identify new patterns and make new correlations. 
Sometimes, they work with engineers to create new data if the known data is insufficient.
Lastly, they use Tableau to effectively communicate their findings.  
Data scientists can perform most of the tasks data analysts perform. 
Additionally, they possess data warehousing, machine learning, programming and statistical modeling skills that help them formulate the most-pressing questions businesses must look to answer. 
They are proficient in programs like - Python, R, SAS, Matlab, SQL, Pig, Hive, Scala and Hadoop. 
Their work is not restricted to what affects customers. 
And, it involves working with data from multiple and often disconnected sources. 
 
Data scientists possess greater business acumen than analysts. 
They are also more adept at visualizing data and communicating insights to varied audiences. 

Given the power of data in today’s world, data scientists can ask the ‘what if’ questions to business stakeholders and IT leaders to alter the course of businesses with powerful story-telling. 
For these reasons, they earn twice as much as data analysts. 

Now you know what sets data scientists apart from data analysts.

Video Transcript
Ryan: Data science is a relatively new field. People always say it's you know it's either statistics, or machine learning, or computer science, and these have been around for a long time. But the thing that's special about it is how these concepts come together in industry. And largely it's about pulling out insights from your data and being able to build better products. Make better decisions, and largely build a better company through the use of this huge torrent of data.

Katie: People in our program are coming from various backgrounds. That include engineering, analytics, and the quantitative sciences.

Man 1: I've been a professional poker player since graduating college.

Aznah: I was a PhD student in planetary science.

Man 2: I was a professor before coming here.

Conner: I worked on Barack Obama's reelection campaign.

Man 3: Working as a software developer I had a very renew-ability seller.

Dan: What really drove me to poker in the first place was that it was a problem to solve. 

Conner: I was using Excel and other tools like that, but I knew there was so much more out there. And I wanted to become a part of.

Aznah: I was working with lots of data sets, but wanted to get into some real world problems.

Conner: The days here are non-stop. We start in the morning with a mini quiz.

Aznah: The afternoon pair exercises are sort of an exercise in collaboration as well as working through a problem.

Conner: Steve Twa showed the coolest presentation where he was doing a live demo of playing songs on his violin, and putting out what song he was actually playing. And showing how machine learning could do that audio processing. So I was blown away by that. I actually really lucked out they connected me with Steve and he became my mentor. It was incredible to see how quickly we kind of all came together and were able to learn a ton of material in such a small amount of time. I could reach out to someone. Show someone my code and have that instant feedback.

Aznah: Everybody is very supportive here. We've formed some really close friendships I think.

Ryan: It's a network of hiring partners, and alumni, and data scientists throughout the field who really come together. And are helping shape and define what data science is, and what it means for the future.

Why learn Python?

Programmers love Python because of how fast and easy it is to use. Python cuts development time in half with its simple to read syntax and easy compilation feature. Debugging your programs is a breeze in Python with its built in debugger. Using Python makes Programmers more productive and their programs ultimately better. Python continues to be a favorite option for data scientists who use it for building and using Machine learning applications and other scientific computations.
Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS and has been ported to Java and .NET virtual machines. Python is free to use, even for the commercial products, because of its OSI-approved open source license. 
Python has evolved as the most preferred Language for Data Analytics and the increasing search trends on python also indicates that Python is the next ""Big Thing"" and a must for Professionals in the Data Analytics domain.

Introduction to Data Science

The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do, this field is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science practitioners and we will get an overview of what data science is today.

Introduction to Data Science

The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people working in data science have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do, this field is data science. In this course, we will meet some data science practitioners and we will get an overview of what data science is today.

She dreamed of pursuing a more rewarding career, but her current role didn’t offer the training or development opportunities she needed. Realizing that she needed to take her future into her own hands, she joined Coursera and enrolled in a data analysis course from Johns Hopkins University.

Six months later, she had a job she was passionate about and was earning more than twice her original salary. She moved from her apartment to a house, and began supporting her younger siblings. From there, she went on to a Master’s degree and a job as a senior data scientist at a startup, where she mentors younger analysts as they complete Coursera courses.

214,9WDO8sqiy_Y,Leda Braga: Data science and its role in investment strategy,"The CEO of Systematica Investments discusses how her company employs technology to achieve returns.

As the first financial services industry speaker at the Women in Data Science (WiDS) conference, keynote presenter Leda Braga, CEO of Systematica Investments, introduced attendees to the role of data science applied to investment. Braga’s company manages large pools of assets from pension funds to insurance company premiums, to sovereign wealth funds of various countries. As a hedge fund manager, the company focuses on two areas of investment management – signal generation and portfolio construction. Signal generation is the process of trying to predict what assets should be bought or sold. Portfolio construction is the process of organizing investments strategically to meet investment objectives and achieve returns.

Portfolio construction is essentially a constrained optimization problem, Braga notes, and as a result, it is an area where data science can help illuminate the best solutions. At Systematica Investments, the company uses data and algorithms to determine how to maximize financial returns given a number of variables with specific constraints within financial markets and environments. At the end of the day, she says, the business of investment management is the business of information management.

Braga believes a passion for data science coupled with an interest in making a difference matters in the field of strategic investing. Worldwide, professionally managed assets are valued at $80 trillion. “If you want to change the world,” she says, “bank your money in the right places. And if you think about investment management as this activity whereby the pools of capital of the world get directed, that is so powerful. And if that is going to become completely data driven over time, you can’t miss that opportunity. You’ve got to join in and have a say.”",Science and Technology

PyData London 2016

This talk outlines my journey from complete novice to machine learning practitioner. It started in November 2015 when I left my job as a project manager, and by April 2016 I was hired as a Data Scientist by a startup developing bleeding edge deep learning algorithms for medical imagery processing.

SHORT INTRO
Who I am, my background and a short summary of my story. Here I will list the steps I personally took to achieve the goal I had.

HOW DID I DO IT?
Why I chose a “hacky” way to enter this career path. The first mover advantage, why getting a degree doesn’t always improve your career prospects. Possibly a rant on the signaling function of formal education and how that is rarely aligned with a relevant practical skill set. Some stats to back it up (best career success predictors). Examples of hacking bureaucracies/social hierarchies from my experience and elsewhere.
List of things not to do and common cognitive pitfalls.
Networking for nerds - how to do it right.
Time management for chronic procrastinators - how to plan a self-guided project. Some notes on psychology of time discounting and need for external reinforcement, with autobiographical examples.

CONCLUSION
You don’t need a PhD or even a masters to do machine learning. On taking calculated risks and especially calculated exits from one’s comfort zone. Some notes on soul searching and how to choose a career that is also a passion. Reading list.

Think about this, almost any organization nowadays gathers data. Often the data just sits somewhere in a database or whatever, but there's a lot of value in that data and if you want to be the person helping pull the value out of that data, then maybe a data science program is for you. 

If you're a data scientist, you're going to spend a lot of your time working with data, manipulating data, joining data, tearing data apart, visualizing data, trying to understand different views of the data, and we call that data munching, and we definitely do that in the program. You'll also learn the mathematical and statistical basis of the analytical methods you'll need as a data scientist, including machine learning methods, which are commonly used in many data science problems.

Another great thing about our UW programs is it gives you a lot of networking opportunities with your instructors, with your fellow students and that can help you find additional jobs, it can help you find just resources to do your job better. There's lots of great professional networking ahead of you if you're in our program.",Science and Technology

About the Course
Data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using a booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as ""data science in action"".

The course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.

Course Syllabus
This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.

The course covers the three main types of process mining. 

The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log. 
The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.
The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.
Process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between ""business"" and ""IT"". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.

The course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.

Probabilistic programming is a new paradigm that greatly increases the number of people who can successfully build statistical models and machine learning algorithms, and makes experts radically more effective. This talk will provide an overview of PyMC3, a new probabilistic programming package for Python featuring intuitive syntax and next-generation sampling algorithms.

Machine learning is the driving force behind many recent revolutions in data science. Comprehensive libraries provide the data scientist with many turnkey algorithms that have very weak assumptions on the actual distribution of the data being modeled. While this blackbox property makes machine learning algorithms applicable to a wide range of problems, it also limits the amount of insight that can be gained by applying them.

The field of statistics on the other hand often approaches problems individually and hand-tailors statistical models to specific problems. To perform inference on these models, however, is often mathematically very challenging, and thus requires time-deriving equations as well as simplifying assumptions (like the normality assumption) to make inference mathematically tractable.

Probabilistic programming is a new programming paradigm that provides the best of both worlds and revolutionizes the field of machine learning. Recent methodological advances in sampling algorithms like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), as well as huge increases in processing power, allow for almost complete automation of the inference process. Probabilistic programming thus greatly increases the number of people who can successfully build statistical models and machine learning algorithms, and makes experts radically more effective. Data scientists can create complex generative Bayesian models tailored to the structure of the data and specific problem at hand, but without the burden of mathematical tractability or limitations due to mathematical simplifications.

This talk will provide an overview of PyMC3, a new probabilistic programming package for Python featuring intuitive syntax and next-generation sampling algorithms.

Video Transcription:
What is Predictive Analytics 
Hello, and welcome back to Data Science Wednesday. My name is Tessa Jones, and I'm a data scientist with Decisive Data. And today we're gonna talk about predictive analytics and what it can do for you. Predictive analytics fits into the spectrum of analytics that we've talked about before. Starting with descriptive, which is the most basic of the analytics, it's basically just cleaning, relating, summarizing, and visualizing your data, really getting to the questions about what's happening in my business. And then there's diagnostic, which is really getting down to why things are happening. What's causing my revenue to decline or to increase? How are things related? Things like that. So if you've got a good base in both of these, then we're ready to move into predictive analytics, which is gonna dive into what's gonna happen in the future, which is super powerful. If you're a business person and you want to be able to make good business questions, if you have at least an idea of what might happen in the future, your answers are already gonna be a little bit better.

So, let's dive in. So, let's go with an example because that just makes it easier to kind of flow through what's actually happening here. So let's pretend that we are grocery store owners. And if we're already talking about predictive analytics, you should have a pretty good grasp on descriptive and predictive and diagnostic analytics. So, you probably already have a decent dashboard that really tells you what's happening in your business right now. So, something like this where you have, you know, something here that tells you revenue by different departments like foods and pastry, or how your sales changes by product over time, things like that. So you have an idea of what's happening in your business, but now you really wanna know, what's gonna happen in my business? So one really common question is, how many of a given product am I gonna sell for every store? Because this can really answer questions around how you're gonna support supply chain processes, or how you're gonna manage the profits that you're going to have. Things like that.

So the first thing we need to do is talk about what happened in the past. We really can't do anything or predict very easily unless we know or at least have an idea of what's happened in the past. So here we have three lines in black that represent, basically, historical data. Each line here is one year worth of sales for a given product. And then the green line here is the current year. And here's today. And if we build a predictive model, it's gonna tell us what's gonna happen for the rest of the year. So if this is all set up and we build a model, basically, we mix this information with all the data that's really clean and well-organized, we mash it together with a bunch of mathematics and coding, and basically, we pop out some results and it shows up in a visual like this where you have, these are the sales that we have had and these are the sales that we think we're going to have. So a business person can look at this chart and say, ""Wow, we need to put a lot more products to this store because I see sales are gonna increase."" Or, ""Our profit margins are gonna be way higher than we thought so we can start a new program."" Things like that. You can really start to get innovative with your business decisions.

So, let's pretend we've built this model and it's been running for a year. And now we wanna know how well is this model actually performing? So down here, we have a chart that shows, in black, what we actually sold, and then in green, what we thought we were going to sell. And we see that there's a couple of pretty big misses. Right here, we sold way more than we thought we would, which leaves risk to, you know, missing out on inventory. Or, here, we predicted we would sell way more than we did. So both of these are kind of misses. And so we need to go back and look at the data and understand what assumptions we applied that were maybe a little bit wrong, or applied incorrectly, or look at the data, maybe we weren't accounting for something and we kind of reorganize that and incorporate it into the model. And then we redeploy it, and then we have a better model.",Science and Technology

Data Science is all about extracting knowledge from data. Data Science is the integration of methods from mathematics, probability models, machine learning, computer programming, statistics, data engineering, pattern recognition and learning, visualization, uncertainty modelling, data warehousing, and high performance computing with the goal of extracting meaning from data and creating data products. This interdisciplinary and cross-functional field leads to decisions that move an organization forward in terms of proposed investment, decisions regarding a product or business strategy. 

Data Science is a buzzword, often used interchangeably with analytics or big data. At times, Analytics is synonymous with Data Science, but at times it represents something else. A Data Scientist using raw data to build a predictive behaviour model, falls in to the category of analytics.

  Why Learn Data Science?
'Data Science' is a term which came into popularity in past decade. Data Science is the process of extracting valuable insights from ""data"". It is the right time to learn Data science because:

We are living in the Big Data Era, Data Science is becoming a very promising field to harness and process huge volumes of data generated from various sources.

A data scientist has a dual role -- that of an ""Analyst"" as well as that of an ""Artist""! Data scientists are very curious, who love large amount of data, and more than that, they love to play with such huge data to reach important inferences and spot trends. You could be one of them!

As 'Data Science' is an emerging field, there is a plethora of opportunities available world across. Just browse through any of the job portals; you will be taken aback by the number of job openings available for Data scientists in different industries, whether it is IT or healthcare, Retail or Government offices or Academics, Life Sciences, Oceanography, etc.

273,GjNFzfwaWUk,"Dividends are Great, but Avoid High Yields | Trading Data Science","Over the last 20 years, approximately 50% of the S&P 500’s returns came from dividends and not capital appreciation.  Dr. Data (Michael Rechenthin, PhD) provides evidence that shows a sound strategy to buy dividend stocks and sell implied volatility out-of-the-money (OTM) calls against the position (which reduces cost basis), but stocks with high dividend yields should be approached with caution.

A graph of the dividend yield of the S&P 500 dividend paying stocks (80% of the index components) was displayed. The graph included a note that 50 of the dividend stocks yielded greater than 4%, and one (WMB) pays a yield of 16%.

A graph comparing dividend yield versus market capitalization on the S&P 500 was displayed. The graph showed that the more stable companies don't have the largest dividend yields and that the stocks that did have high yields had them because their stock price dropped, sometimes by a lot. When you pick high dividend stocks, such as ones more than 4%, you may just end up picking stocks that are underperforming.

274,J8GYPG6pt5,KotlinConf 2017 - Kotlin for Data Science by Thomas Nield,"""Data Science"" is a broad buzzword encompassing the study and analysis of data, often using programming tools like R, Python, and Scala. But can a pragmatic language like Kotlin address many challenges currently faced in the data science domain?

Kotlin offers pragmatic, concise syntax and features that can quickly express business logic. It not only handles business complexity with grace and speed, but also introduces type safety and resiliency. Kotlin might be able to close the gap between data science and software engineering, allowing data scientists to model towards production and not just prototypes.

This session will help you discover how Kotlin can take data science to new heights, and how you (the community!) can be the catalyst to drive it.

Thomas Nield is a Business Consultant for Southwest Airlines in Schedule Initiatives, often balancing business analytics with tactical technology development. He is a maintainer/contributor for a number of OSS projects including RxKotlin, RxJavaFX, Kotlin-Statistics, TornadoFX, and RxPy. Thomas is an author/speaker at O'Reilly Media with a book, videos, and webcasts covering topics like SQL, reactive programming, and data science.

DATA SCIENCE 
A primeira coisa que devemos saber sobre Data Science é que é uma ciência um pouco difícil de se definir. Tudo por causa da sua natureza multidisciplinar e também pelas múltiplas áreas da ciência que ela se aplica. Data Science pode ser aplicada desde a física a astrofísica, passando pela economia, educação, saúde, esportes, telecomunicações, biotecnologia, mercado de ações, análise de compra e venda em varejo e atacado, análise de dados científicos e etc.

Em todas as áreas que geram dados, tanto científico como comercial, e a partir desses dados, deseja-se obter melhor entendimento de um certo fenômeno, tanto do passado como do futuro, Data Science pode ser aplicada. É isso mesmo... de eventos baseados em dados que podem acontecer. Isso é a parte mais forte da ciência de dados. Prever fenômenos que podem acontecer. Sobre tudo de coisas que passam desapercebidas pelo olhar humano.

E como isso é possível? 
Sabe, quando eu quero ensinar algo que é um pouco difícil de se definir para os meus alunos nos cursos superiores ligados a computação, eu sempre uso um recurso que é infalível. 
Um exemplo.

Essa é uma história real da aplicação de Data Science a um dos esportes mais amados nos Estados Unidos, O Baseball.
Essa história está no filme ""O homem que mudou o jogo"". O titulo em inglês é Moneyball que eu recomendo que você assista.

Esse filme foi estrelado por Brad Pitt e mostra como um gerente de esportes de um pequeno time de baseball americano desafiou o sistema, desafiou o conhecimento convencional do baseball e é forçado a reconstruir sua equipe com poucos recursos financeiros. Apesar da oposição da velha guarda, dos seus olheiros, dos meios de comunicação e dos fãs e de seu próprio time, tal dirigente desenvolve uma lista de jogadores considerados inaptos e muda totalmente a forma de montar um time de baseball usando Data Science.

No início, o projeto foi boicotado sobre tudo pelo técnico do time, que não aceitava as ideias modernas das previsões geradas pelos modelos matemáticos feitas por um cientista de dados.
E no começo da temporada, o Athletics joga mal, fazendo com que os críticos, dentro e fora da equipe, digam que o novo método era um fracasso.  Mas após a adesão e confiança nas previsões feitas, o Oakland A's venceu nada mais nada menos que 20 partidas seguidas, batendo um recorde de partidas seguidas que não era quebrado desde 1927.

A chave para esse caso de sucesso, foi começar a utilizar dados e estatísticas de desempenho dos jogadores no campo e com isso achar atletas baratos, mas que possuíam boas características nas posições em que poderiam jogar e que pudessem estar no time em certo momento no jogo. E os insights dos dados de todo o time previu uma equipe altamente competitiva com custo baixo. E que de fato aconteceu! Data Science fez o Oakland Athletics, um dos times com o menor orçamento da liga profissional de beisebol dos Estados Unidos, disputar play-offs do campeonato nacional. E esse fato mudou totalmente a fase de contratação de jogadores nos times americanos. Efetivamente mudou o Jogo.

E o que é Data Science então?
Quando falamos sobre Data Science (do inglês) ou ciência de dados (em português), basicamente estamos falando sobre técnicas, processos e métodos científicos, com a finalidade de extrair conhecimento ou o que a gente chama em inglês de insights, que é essa percepção, essa revelação de informações importantes, um descortinar de entendimento a partir dos dados. Tanto de eventos que já aconteceram, como de eventos que podem acontecer. Principalmente, vendo um futuro que ninguém vê. Um futuro baseado em dados. 

Data Science é uma ciência que pode ser aprendida e aplicada por qualquer um que queira obter percepções de fenômenos representados por dados, extraindo valores altamente significativos. Assim como aconteceu no time de baseball Oakland A's. 

Então.
Você tem dados?
Já pensou em fazer algo desse jeito?
Eu te falo que não é tão difícil assim de ser realizado. O que você precisa é de dados e de alguém que manipule com habilidade tais dados... mas porque não ser você mesmo?

Essa é uma das intenções desse canal. 

Que você possa aprender a integrar Data Science ao seu dia-a-dia, extraindo valores e insights significativos a qualquer projeto que você queira desenvolver ou está desenvolvendo. E aí, vamos juntos?

Um grande abraço para você",Science and Technology

Data scientists often don't have experience working as software developers and never learned how to write tests for their code. Things get even more complicated when your code has non-deterministic outcomes as is the case with probabalistic models. In this talk, I'll introduce the concept of unit testing for data scientists and discuss how to make testing a part of their normal workflow.

Data scientists often don't have experience working as software developers and never learned how to write unit tests for their code. They may be used to writing and executing code interactively or in an ad hoc fashion; they may be unused to writing code that runs without supervision or as part of a larger pipeline. Things get even more complicated when code has non-deterministic outcomes as is the case with probabalistic models. In this talk, I'll introduce the concept of unit testing, describe how to write good tests, and discuss how to make testing a part of a normal data science workflow.

310,LLxRqEJHk,Simulation: The Challenge for Data Science,"While machine learning has recently had dramatic successes, there is a large class of problems that it will never be able to address on its own.  To test a policy proposal, for example, often requires understanding a counterfactual scenario that has never existed in the past, and that may fundamentally alter the statistical properties of data in the future.  Simulation models provide an alternative, in which one incorporates much stronger prior knowledge about structure and causal interaction.  Making such models quantitatively accurate enough that they can be trusted for policy analysis poses difficult challenges for parameter estimation and initialization.   Simulation models are usually formulated in terms of micro-states, such as individual households, whereas measurements are often only available at an aggregate level, such as GDP or unemployment.

To run a simulation as a time series model to forecast macro-states requires initializing the micro-states of the model to match macroscopic data, and can create severe problems if not done carefully.  Borrowing from methods of data assimilation used in meteorology, we introduce a new method for solving this problem.  I will review the literature on parameter estimation for simulation models and discuss the relevant challenges and the opportunities to create a fusion with machine learning.  My main point is that the problems of parameter estimation and initialization for simulation models are at the cutting edge of data science.  These problems are ripe to be solved, and their solution will catapult simulation science to a level of usefulness similar to that of machine learning.  Work in this area should figure prominently on the agenda of The Alan Turing Institute.

334,Mb038zOz2fM,Alexander Kagoshima: A Data Science Operationalization Framework,"In a lot of our Data Science customer engagements at Pivotal, the question comes up how to put the developed Data Science models into production. Usually, the code produced by the Data Scientist is a bunch of scripts that go from data loading over data cleansing to feature extraction and then model training. There is rarely much thought put into how the resulting model can be used by other pieces of software and this is generally not a good practice of encapsulating the Data Scientist's work for others to re-use.What we as Data Scientists want is to create models that drive automated decision-making but there is clearly a mismatch to the above way of going about Big Data projects. Considering these challenges, we created a small prototype for a Data Science operationalization framework. This allows the Data Scientist to implement a model which is exposed by the framework as a REST API for easy access by software developers.The difference to other predictive APIs is that this framework allows for automatic periodic retraining of the implemented model on incoming streaming data and is able to free the Data Scientist of some tedious work - like Ÿkeeping track of results for different modelling and feature engineering approaches, basic visualization of model performance and the creation of multiple model instances for different data streams. It is written by practitioning Data Scientists for Data Scientists.Moreover, the framework will be released this year under an Open Source license which means that unlike other predictive APIs which only host one instance for Data Scientists to push their models to, this allows Data Scientists to completely control their own model codebase. In addition, it is deployable on Cloud Foundry and Heroku and can thus use some features of PaaS, which means less work in thinking about how to deploy and scale a model in production. The model is implemented in Python and uses Flask to expose the REST API and the current prototype uses Redis as backend storage for the trained models. Models can be either custom-written or use existing Python ML libraries like scikit-learn. The framework is currently geared towards online learning, but it is possible to hook it up to a Spark backend to realize model training in batch on large datasets.

340,iaWvDXYg67,Mathematics of Data Science - Data Science is Everywhere,"Data science - what's under the hood? This animation, from the SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science, explains that data science really is EVERYWHERE! 

SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science (SIMODS) publishes work that advances mathematical, statistical, and computational methods in the context of data and information sciences. We invite papers that present significant advances in this context, including applications to science, engineering, business, and medicine.

---
FULL MANUSCRIPT:
Right now, you’re a few clicks away from streaming a 4K video tour of a far-away city, and exploring a 3D map of it in virtual reality. If you want to actually visit the city, your phone can arrange for a car — maybe even a self-driving car — to pick you up just as you land. While it’s shuttling you around, apps can suggest hotels and sites to visit.

We are living in the age of data science.

Data science is everywhere, but how does it actually work? When the data analysts, scientists, and engineers who build these applications run up against the limits of what’s currently possible, how do they make the next breakthrough?    

The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics has a new journal for mathematicians, computer scientists, geneticists, neuroscientists, economists and anyone who works with big data: the SIAM Journal on Mathematics of Data Science, known as SIMODS.

Through SIMODS, researchers are popping the the hood and tinkering with the engine that makes these applications work, and work better: applied mathematics, and the related domains of computer science, statistics, signal processing, and network science.

The compression techniques that allow you to stream a 4K movie are in a constant race with growing file sizes. In the future, techniques like matrix sketching can be used to efficiently discover  the underlying low-dimensional manifold and achieve even greater compression rates. This will make your movies stream faster and with better image quality.

Deep learning techniques use stochastic optimization for quick and accurate translations. Even more powerful techniques will be necessary to handle the technical language found in specialized categories of speech, like those in law, medicine, and science.

What about unsupervised learning, where there are no categories at all? 

Would you trust your computer to organize the photos from your trip, with no instructions on what folders to make? What about images of brain scans, and your computer could find never-before-seen patterns and correlations that human neuroscientists would never think to look for? Applied math techniques like clustering can make these organizational tasks even better, allowing for applications that seem like science fiction today.    

Looking forward, imagine machine learning methods that can keep your data completely private, explain their decisions while offering customized suggestions, and be robust to new situations. Can data science move us forward in terms of fairness and diversity? What about using algorithms to achieve long-term goals?

Computer scientists and engineers are inventing the future every day, and applied mathematics gives them the tools they need to keep moving forward. SIMODS is looking for interdisciplinary work that pushes the boundaries of data science and takes the field in new directions.",Science and Technology

With more computing power and real-time streaming, has analytics become omnipresent? AI, ML and DL are here to stay. But in the midst of Asimov’s RPA revolution – where is the need for human intervention in designing solutions? The NextGen analytics is all about aesthetics, and values - and not just the law of gravity – but laws of tide.

For the past 20 years, companies have been changing their centers of gravity in their decision making units from human expertise to big data driven systems. This change can be attributed to the biases of human experts in information processing in relation to the explosion of in-company data. This massive collection of data is often referred nowadays as big data. 

This Master of Science program is a very hands-on practical program that forms data driven managers who help the organization in converting the overload of company data to valuable knowledge in order to help the organization move from a subjective good-feeling base management to a more objective data driven management style. 

The program explores the data driven opportunities in the field of marketing, finance and operations. The program delivers deep knowledge in 3 areas: business knowledge, methodological knowledge and technological knowledge.

The learning objectives then are summarized as the following. 
- Firstly, integration of information technology, business knowledge and data signs to maximize the value of big data. 
- Secondly, we offer students a tool kit of methodological and programming skills to solve real life business problems. Thirdly, we      identify and assess the opportunities, needs and constraints for big data usage within organizations. 
- Last but not least, we design innovative and creative data analytical solutions for marketing, finance and operations. 

The detailed overview of the program follows an education funnel. The program starts very wide with basic courses related to the three core competencies of a data driven manager (business, methodology and technology). Then, participants of the program are immersed in three specific application areas, marketing, finance and operations. The courses consist of traditional lectures, group works and case studies. A connected vision to our program in the MSc will plunge participants in a day-to-day world of existing companies.

Being accessed via web browser they allow scientists to easily structure their work by combining code and documentation.

Yet notebooks often lead to isolated and disposable analysis artefacts. Keeping the computation inside those notebooks does not allow for convenient concurrent model training, model exposure or scheduled model retraining.

Those issues can be addressed by taking advantage of recent developments in the discipline of software engineering. Over the past years containerization became the technology of choice for crafting and deploying applications. Building a data science platform that allows for easy access (via notebooks), flexibility and reproducibility (via containerization) combines the best of both worlds and addresses Data Scientist's hidden needs.",Science and Technology

Answering the question 'What is the best programming language for' is never black and white and there will be circumstances when python is not the best choice. Python is, though, the best general programming language. It is well supported, comparatively simple to learn, has a wealth of libraries specifically designed for data science such as pandas for data analysis and matplotlib for data visualization, and is extremely versatile.

393,8nBc-zRaM,Skills Needed For Data Scientist and Data Analyst,"In this Video, We will be discussing about the skills needed for data analyst and data scientist roles.

The reason for making one video to discuss both data analyst and data scientist roles is because there are a lot things in common 
between both these two role.


Data Analyst does a lot of descriptive analytics. On the other hand, Data Scientist also does descriptive analytics. But also data scientists do something called
predictive analytics.

So let's try to understand what Descriptive and Predictive analytics mean.


Descriptive Analytics is all about analyzing the historical data to answer this particular question which is ""WHAT HAS HAPPENED TILL NOW??"".


Predictive Analytics also involves analysis of historical data but, predictive analytics is mainly all about answering the question 
which is.. ""WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE??""

Let's understand this with a simple example.
I have sales data of XYZ company in a table format.

As part of descriptive analytics, we can simply create a scatter chart so that we can quickly understand how the company has been performing
in terms of sales in the previous years.

Now let's look at predictive analytics. So now that we know how the company has been performing in the previous years, can we predict what's gonna 
happen to the sales in the coming years?.. Will the sales increase, or decrease or does it remain the same??.. 
If we are able to answer these questions, then it is called as predictive analytics.

So coming back to the comparison of Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles, 
Now that we have some idea about the differences between the two roles, lets now look at skills needed for each of these two roles.

Data Analysts should be good with Math and Statistics.
They should be good with handling the data.
 -- This includes knowledge of ETL (or Extract Transform and Load) operations on data and experience working with popular
 ETL tools such as Informatica – PowerCenter,IBM – Infosphere Information Server, alteryx,
 Microsoft – SQL Server Integrated Services (SSIS), Talend Open Studio, SAS – Data Integration Studio
 ,SAP – BusinessObjects Data Integrator, QlikView Expressor or any other popular ETL tool.
 -- They should be comfortable in handling data from different sources and
 in different formats such as text, csv, tsv, excel, json, rdbms and others popular formats.
 -- They should have excellent knowledge of SQL (or Structured Query Language).

 Its a Bonus to have 
 -- The knowledge of Big data tools and technologies to handle large data sets.
 -- NoSQL databases such as HBase, Cassandra and MongoDB.
They should be expert in Analysing and Visualizing the data.
 -- They Should have experience working with popular data analysis and visualization packages in python and R 
    such as numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, ggplot and others.
 -- Experience with popular data analysis and visualization BI tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, SAP BI, SAS BI, Oracle BI, QlikView or any other 
 popular BI tool
They should have good communication and storytelling skills.


Lets now look at the skills needed for data scientist role.

Data scientist also does descriptive analytics just like data analysts. Apart from that, they also do predictive analytics.

So as part of Descriptive analytics:
Data Scientists should be excellent with Math and Statistics.
Data scientists should be good with handling data
 -- So yes, they should have experience working with popular ETL frameworks.
 -- They should have excellent knowledge of SQL.
 -- Many companies expect data scientists to have mandatory knowledge of big data tools and technologies to 
    work with large datasets and also to work with structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. 
 -- Its good to have the knowledge of NoSQL databases such as HBase, Cassandra and MongoDB.
They should be expert in Analysing and Visualizing the data.
 -- Experience working with popular data analysis and visualization packages in python and R.
 -- Experience with popular data analysis and visualization BI tools such as Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, SAP BI, SAS BI, Oracle BI, QlikView or any other 
 popular BI tool.
They should also have excellent communication and storytelling skills.

And as part of predictive analytics, 
They should be good in using the techniques in artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and statistical modeling to make
   future predictions using the historical data.
Exposure to popular predictive analytics tools such as SAP Predictive analytics, Minitab, SAS Predictive Analytics, Alteryx Analytics, IBM 
    predictive analytics or any other popular predictive analytics tool.
They should have very good exposure to popular machine learning and deep learning packages available for Python and R such as 
    scikit learn, tensorflow, theano,rpart, caret, randomForest, nnet, and other popular libraries.",Science and Technology

But each time those fears arose in the past, technological innovation resulted in creating more jobs than it destroyed, causing the majority of economists to confidently wave away such automation anxieties.

Those anxieties have reappeared in recent years, as automation is applied to activities requiring intelligence and cognitive capabilities that not long ago were viewed as the exclusive domain of humans.  The concerns surrounding AI's long term impact may well be in a class by themselves.  Like no other technology, AI forces us to explore the very boundaries between machines and humans.

What is the likely impact of AI, robotics and machine learning on jobs?  What kinds of skills are most important to better co-exist with our increasingly smart machines?  What role should universities play to help us better prepare students for the 21st Century digital economy?

416,49fADBfcDD4,Intro to Data Visualization with R & ggplot2,"The R programming language is experiencing rapid increases in popularity and wide adoption across industries. This popularity is due, in part, to R’s rich and powerful data visualization capabilities. While tools like Excel, Power BI, and Tableau are often the go-to solutions for data visualizations, none of these tools can compete with R in terms of the sheer breadth of, and control over, crafted data visualizations.  

As an example, R’s ggplot2 package provides the R programmer with dozens of print-quality visualizations – where any visualization can be heavily customized with a minimal amount of code. 

In this webinar Dave Langer will provide an introduction to data visualization with the ggplot2 package. The focus of the webinar will be using ggplot2 to analyze your data visually with a specific focus on discovering the underlying signals/patterns of your business. 

Attendees will learn how to: 

• Craft ggplot visualizations, including customization of rendered output. 

• Choose optimal visualizations for the type of data and the nature of the analysis at hand. 

• Leverage ggplot2’s powerful segmentation capabilities to achieve “visual drill-in of data”. 

• Export ggplot2 visualizations from RStudio for use in documents and presentations.

From the transcript:

Stan Humphries:

() I’ve been with Zillow since the very beginning back in 2005, when what became Zillow was just a glimmer in our eye. Back then, I worked a lot on just algorithms, and some part development pieces; kind of a lot of the data pieces within the organization. We launched Zillow in February of 2006, and back then, I think people familiar with Zillow now may not remember that between our first couple of years between 2006 and 2008, all you could find on Zillow was really all the public record information about homes and displayed on a map. And then, a Zestimate, which is an estimated the home value of every single home, and then a bunch of housing indices to help people understand what was happening to prices in their local markets. But, we really grew the portfolio of offerings to help consumers from there and added in ultimately For Sale listings, mortgage listings, a mortgage marketplace, a home improvement marketplace, and then, along the way, also brought in other brands. So now, Zillow Group includes not only Zillow brand itself, Zillow.com but also Trulia, as well as StreetEasy in New York, Naked Apartments, which is a rental website in New York, HotPads, and a few other brands as well. So it’s really kind of grown over the years and last month, all those brands combined got about 171 million unique users to them online. So, it’s been a lot of fun kind of seeing it evolve over the years.

() How has the Zestimate changed?

Stan Humphries:

() if you look at when we first rolled out in 2006, the Zestimate was a valuation that we placed on every single home that we had in our database at that time, which was 43 million homes. And, in order to create that valuation in 43 million homes, it ran about once a month and we pushed a couple terabytes of data through about 34 thousand statistical models, which we thought was, and was, compared to what had been done previously, was an enormously more computationally sophisticated process. But if you flash forward to today; well actually I should just give you a context of what our accuracy was back then. Back in 2006 when we launched, we were at about 14% median absolute percent error on 43 million homes. So what we've done since, is we've gone from 43 million homes to 110 million homes today where we put valuations on all 110 million homes. And, we've driven our accuracy down to about 5% today which, we think, from a machine learning perspective, is actually quite impressive because those 43 million homes that we started with in 2006 tended to be in the largest metropolitan areas where there was a lot of transactional velocity. There were a lot of sales and price signals with which to train the models.

() What's in the rest of, as we went from 43 million to 110, you're now getting out into places like Idaho and Arkansas where there are just fewer sales to look at. And, it would have been impressive if we had kept our error rate at 14% while getting out to places that are harder to estimate. But, not only did we more than double our coverage from 43 to 110 million homes but we also almost tripled our accuracy rate from 14% down to 5%.

() Now, the hidden story of how we’re able to achieve that was basically by throwing enormously more data, collecting more data, and getting a lot more sophisticated algorithmically in what we are doing, which requires us to use more computers. Just to give a context, I said that back when we launched, we built 34 thousand statistical models every single month. Today, we update the Zestimate every single night and in order to do that, we generate somewhere between 7 and 11 million statistical models every single night, and then when we’re done with that process, we throw them away, and we repeat again the next night. So, it’s a big data problem.",Science and Technology

In the last few years data science has become an increasingly popular discipline. Often linked to the use and analysis of ‘big data’, data scientists are seen as the new professionals who can unlock the potential of an increasingly data-rich world, and to generate economic and social benefits from the data revolution.

However within the world of statistics, the ‘big data’ and ‘data scientist’ developments are sometimes labelled as hypes, and ‘data science’ is seen as a rebranding of what should be statistics. One of the often heard criticisms of big data analytics is that there’s a lack of statistical rigour which can lead to the wrong decisions.

As with any new discipline there are questions about exactly what data science is. Has the relevance of statistics been diminished because of new types of data or technologies which need a radical new approach? Is data science about ‘getting the job done’, and statistics about the deeper scientific understanding? Are our universities offering students the right skill sets to meet the high demand for data scientists?",Science and Technology

466,YsQEg6OroiQ,Big Graph Data Science,"Abstract:  
One of the challenges in big data analytics lies in being able to reason collectively about extremely large, heterogeneous, incomplete, and noisy interlinked data. We need data science techniques which can represent and reason effectively with this form of rich and multi-relational graph data. In this talk, I will describe some common inference patterns needed for graph data including: collective classification (predicting missing labels for nodes), link prediction (predicting potential edges), and entity resolution (determining when two nodes refer to the same underlying entity). I will describe some key capabilities required to solve these problems, and finally I will describe a highly scalable open-source probabilistic programming language being developed within my group to solve these challenges.

Jobs related to data science are booming right now with the tech industry growing at a rapid pace, but there is a lot of confusion between the Role of a Data Scientist and a Data Analyst...

I am going to QUICKLY breakdown the difference for you so that you can get started right away with your career in the Data Analytics industry!

First of all what is data analytics...

Data analytics is the extraction a large, large, large amounts of data that are stored within a data base. This data comes from a multiplicity of places all over the world via website traffic, in-store and online purchases, social media activity, traffic patterns, etc, etc, etc.... the list could go on and on.

Basically everything we do is being collected to be used as data to advertise to us, keep us safer when we are driving, or help us find the restaurant we want to eat at.

Now to The Role of Data Scientist - The IT Rock Star!

Data Scientists are the top professionals in their industry. They usually hold a Masters Degree in some relative Computer Science degree or even a PhD.  They understand, very well, data from a business point of view and he/she can make accurate prediction of the data to advise clients on their next big business move! Data scientists have a solid foundation of computer applications, modeling, statistics and math!

Ability to do high levels of math quickly
Fantastic Statistical Analysis Abilities
Great Communication Skill: Written and Oral
And they have a brilliant Knack for communicating between the IT world and the Business Professionals.

Starting Salary: $115,000



The Role of Data Analyst

A Data Analyst is very important in the world of data science. They are in charge of collecting, organizing, and and obtaining statistical information from a large amount of data sets (Data sets are very large pools of data that must be searched in order to find the data that is relevant to a specific study). They are also the ones responsible for formulating all of their findings into an accurate report of powerpoint presentation to give to their client or internal team.

Strong Understanding of Hadoop Based Analytics (Program to help extract data from large data sets and the analyze the data)
Familiar with data analytics in a business setting

Dave Hastie,
Sporting Data Science

In this webinar Dave will discuss his consultancy work within the sports industry as a data scientist at Sporting Data Science. Having started in this area in 2003, Dave has worked with professional sports teams and confederations, broadcasters, companies building fan engagement products and organisations linked to sports betting. To date his work has focussed on football, tennis and cricket but the approach can apply to many other sports.

The talk will provide a flavour of Dave’s work, giving examples covering the whole data science pipeline, including data wrangling, data analysis, visualisation and statistical modelling. The webinar will cover some of the challenges working within the industry. Specifically, Dave will focus on communicating complex ideas and receiving buy-in amongst traditional sports executives and fans, who rarely have a statistical background but are considered to be experts in their domain.

The final part of the talk will look at the specific question of how empirical based models developed by domain experts compare to the parametric or non-parametric models that are the basis of the statistical modeller’s toolbox. As part of this question, Dave will also address the issue of model assessment and some of the difficulties in comparing models within this domain.",Science and Technology

Why Big Data Analytics is the Best Career Path? Become a big Data Engineer in 2018.

Why Big Data Analytics is the Best Career Path?

Hello guys my name is Daniel and you are watching beginner tuts and in this video, we are going to talk about why big data analytics is the best career path? If you’re looking for an amazing career option in information technology and don’t know anything about this industry, then this video can help you become a big data analytics engineer. The Average salary of a big data engineer is 100,000 annually… That’s right guys. 100 grand a year. Now you must be wondering, what the heck is big data??

Big data is a term for data sets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing application software is too weak to deal with them. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating and information privacy.

The Great White is considered to be the King of the Ocean. This is because the great White is on top of its game. Imagine if you could be on top of the game in the ocean of Big Data!

Big Data is everywhere and there is almost an urgent need to collect and preserve whatever data is being generated, for the fear of missing out on something important. There is a huge amount of data floating around. What we do with it is all that matters right now. This is why Big Data Analytics is in the frontiers of IT. Big Data Analytics has become crucial as it aids in improving business, decision makings and providing the biggest edge over the competitors. This applies for organizations as well as professionals in the Analytics domain. For professionals, who are skilled in Big Data Analytics, there is an ocean of opportunities out there.

.

Why Big Data Analytics is the Best Career move?
If you are still not convinced by the fact that Big Data Analytics is one of the hottest skills, here are 5 more reasons for you to see the big picture.

1. Soaring Demand for Analytics Professionals:
Jeanne Harris, senior executive at Accenture Institute for High Performance, has stressed the significance of analytics professionals by saying, “…data is useless without the skill to analyze it.” There are more job opportunities in Big Data management and Analytics than there were last year and many IT professionals are prepared to invest time and money for the training.

The job trend graph for Big Data Analytics, from Indeed.com, proves that there is a growing trend for it and as a result there is a steady increase in the number of job opportunities.

 

The current demand for qualified data professionals is just the beginning. Srikanth, the Bangalore-based cofounder and CEO of CA headquartered Fractal Analytics states: “In the next few years, the size of the analytics market will evolve to at least one-thirds of the global IT market from the current one-tenths”.

Technology professionals who are experienced in Analytics are in high demand as organizations are looking for ways to exploit the power of Big Data. The number of job postings related to Analytics in Indeed and Dice has increased substantially over the last 12 months. Other job sites are showing similar patterns as well. This apparent surge is due to the increased number of organizations implementing Analytics and thereby looking for Analytics professionals.

In a study by QuinStreet Inc., it was found that the trend of implementing Big Data Analytics is zooming and is considered to be a high priority among U.S. businesses. A majority of the organizations are in the process of implementing it or actively planning to add this feature within the next two years.

2. Huge Job Opportunities & Meeting the Skill Gap:
The demand for Analytics skill is going up steadily but there is a huge deficit on the supply side. This is happening globally and is not restricted to any part of geography. In spite of Big Data Analytics being a ‘Hot’ job, there is still a large number of unfilled jobs across the globe due to shortage of required skill. A McKinsey Global Institute study states that the US will face a shortage of about 190,000 data scientists and 1.5 million managers and analysts who can understand and make decisions using Big Data by 2018.

According to Srikanth, co-founder and CEO of Fractal Analytics, there are two types of talent deficits: Data Scientists, who can perform analytics and Analytics Consultant, who can understand and use data. The talent supply for these job title, especially Data Scientists is extremely scarce and the demand is huge.

3. Salary Aspects:
Strong demand for Data Analytics skills is boosting the wages for qualified professionals and making Big Data pay big bucks for the right skill. This phenomenon is being seen globally where countries like Australia and the U.K are witnessing this ‘Moolah Marathon’.",Science and Technology
512,LrNlZ7-SMPk,Big Data Analytics: Answers from Big Data,"Keynote video, presented at the SAS Analytics Conference 2012, by William Hakes, CEO and Co-Founder of Link Analytics.

Big Data Analytics is not just hype.  
Big Data Analytics is more than technology. It's a new way of thinking.
Here's proof as to why we need Big Data Analytics: 
In 2012, the world's information totaled over 2 zetabyes. That's 2 trillion gigabytes. 
By 2020, that number will be 35 trillion. 
80% of this new data is unstructured. 
It is too large, too complex, and too disorganized to be analyzed by traditional tools.  
We need new tools and new talent to navigate this information and find value. 
We are at the beginning of the Big Data Revolution.

523,6cM80RM8,Creating a Matrix in R - Learn R with 365 Data Science,"How to create a matrix in R, a step-by-step tutorial. 
matrix, rownames, colnames, cbind, rbind

What are matrices:

1. When it comes to storing data, matrices are a natural extension to vectors: while vectors are 1-dimensional collections of data, matrices are two-dimensional arrays;
2. Matrices have a fixed number of rows and columns;
3. Matrices, same as vectors, can contain only one basic data type. This makes sense: you create a matrix from a vector. You can think of it as curving the vector into rows or columns, and just as a vector can only store doubles, or characters, or logicals, and so on, so can a matrix.

There are two methods for creating a matrix in R. The matrix() function, and the rbind() and cbind() functions.

matrix() takes at least two arguments: a vector it can structure into a matrix, and an argument specifying the number of rows the new object must have, called nrow. Alternatively, you can pass the number of columns you want your matrix to have, by specifying ncol.

When creating the matrix, R fills out the first column first, then moves on to the second, and so on. To organize your data by rows, use the byrow argument in the matrix() function, and set it to TRUE instead of its default FALSE.

Using rbind and cbind to create a matrix. Rbind stands for row bind, and cbind for column bind.

Naming the components of a matrix is just like naming a vector but instead of the names() function, matrices recognise the colnames() and rownames() functions.

Dr. Linda McIver started out as an Academic with a Ph.D. in Computer Science Education. When it became apparent that High School teaching was a lot more fun, Linda began a highly successful career at John Monash Science School, where she built innovative courses in Computational and Data Science for year 10 and year 11 students.

Nominated one of the inaugural Superstars of STEM in 2017, Linda is passionate about creating authentic project experiences to motivate all students to become technologically and data literate.

While Linda loves the classroom, it was rapidly becoming clear that teachers in the Australian School system were keen to embrace Data Science, but that there was a serious lack of resources to support that. That’s why Linda created ADSEI – to support Data Science in education.

Hi, This is Arjun. I am a mentor at Springboard. I would like to brief about my Journey into Data Science, to better understand that I would like to share my experience for the same.

I started my career as a Data Analyst, post this Business Analyst, after that Senior Business Analyst, moving to Lead Data Scientist, and then Manager Data Science which was into different domains and into different verticals.

So, what I want to focus here is irrespective of what designation people give you in different companies it doesn't matter. The main point is what problem you are going to solve for your company or for anything. Basically, if you want to start your journey into Data Science, the most important thing should be what problem are you solving from the beginning. It does not matter, you might be in different streams, people would be working in JAVA, PHP or any different software there is a bunch of software out there. This does not matter basically in my view because the main focus should be irrespective of the software, irrespective of the vertical, we can still use Data Science in every aspect of our life, even on day to day basis. Every step of our life from the time you wake until the time you fall asleep. The focus or the ideology in learning Data Science should be in understanding what day to day problem will I be solving while learning Data Science. It can be learning different algorithms in Data Science etc. So, this should be the main focus of any beginner who is going to start their journey in Data Science. If this is the focus or the ideology, prime ideology that you have then definitely your journey into Data Science will be very fascinating and automatically everything falls in place, you don’t have to figure out things or what problem to solve. Each and every aspect when you think. It can be linked to your particular lifestyle, it can be solving some other person, some different people, different play part of the earth where you are trying to solve their problem. So, there are a lot of problems to solve on our planet, the sky is the limit. Just start your journey asking why and whatever you learn, try to apply it as soon as possible. Apply it on the go and solve the problems it's going to be fun.",Science and Technology

Python Pandas Documentation: 

Let me know if you have any questions!

In this video we walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library. We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data. Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. We finished the video talking about how you would work with a very large dataset (many gigabytes)

I realized as I upload this video there are some additional things I want to talk about in a later video. The first thing that comes to mind immediately is using the apply() function on a dataframe to alter the data using a custom or lambda function. If you have questions on this or anything else before I get around to making  a part 2, feel free to write me a note in the comments.

Here is the Machine Learning course (First Lecture) by Prof. Chloé-Agathe Azencott, Centre for Computational Biology, Mines ParisTech.
September 2015Part 1/7: What is machine learning? 

Machine learning lies at the heart of data science. It is essentially
the intersection between statistics and computation, though the
principles of machine learning have been rediscovered from many
different traditions, including artificial intelligence, Bayesian
statistics, and frequentist statistics. In this course, we view machine
learning as the automatic learning of a prediction function given a
training sample of data (labeled or not).

Machine learning methods form the foundation of many successful
companies and technologies in multiple domains. Their applications, to
name a few, include search engines, robotics, bioinformatics analyses of
genetic data, algorithmic trading, social network analysis, targeted
advertising, computer vision, or machine translation.

This course gives an overview of the most important trends in machine
learning, with a particular focus on statistical risk and its
minimization with respect to a prediction function. A substantial lab
section involves group projects on data science competitions and gives
students the ability to apply the course theory to real-world problems.",Science and Technology

568,F9wlX1xQ,Indexing an element from a matrix - Learn R with 365 Data Science,"Learn how to select and extract single and multiple values from a matrix in R.

Extracting a value from a matrix happens with square brackets, and the values you want extracted in them. If you’re working with more-dimensional objects, think of R’s extraction schema as looking like this: [ , ].

If we want to extract a row from a matrix, we should we should type row number, COMMA, and use a blank space to indicate that you want every value on that row.

The exact same logic applies to extracting an entire column from a matrix, but this time, the comma precedes the column index.

Selecting multiple elements.
 
When talking about vector slicing we learned that we can just pass a vector in the square brackets that indexes the multiple elements we want to extract. The same rule applies to matrices. For example, to select the 1st, 3rd, and 7th rows, all we need to do is open square brackets, pass in a vector of indexes where the rows element is – close the parentheses – comma, and close the square brackets.

We can subset matrices using the column names, and row names, too.

To extract a named row from a matrix, pass in the name of the row, and leave the space for columns blank.
