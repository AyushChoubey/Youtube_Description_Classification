0,6VYB3a9bbiA,24 CRAZY SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS YOU`VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,"We have a lot of things stored in the kitchen, with which you can put interesting experiments for children. And for yourself to make a couple of discoveries and wonder why you never noticed this before? 
One of the most interesting experiments you can do at home is elastic eggs! You have no idea how that's possible? It's easy! This experiment is a classic example of an acid base reaction. This reaction dissolves the shell, but leaves the inner membrane intact, creating a bare egg.
Put the egg in a glass jar. Add vinegar. Pour enough vinegar to cover the egg, and a little more. First the eggs swim, but then they sink.
Watch the bubbles! Within a minute of adding vinegar, tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide appear on the eggshell. This is one part of the chemical reaction that takes place inside the jar.
Close the lid and leave for a few days, and can be a week. The egg will get a little bigger. The brown color of the eggshell pales. A layer of scale appears on the surface of the vinegar. You can replace the vinegar in a couple of days.
After a week, carefully remove the egg from the vinegar. Wash and wipe gently. You will see that the eggshell has become soft, it is pliable even with a light touch. It's like a naked egg!
Naked eggs are really cool. The inner membrane remains intact, so the eggs are quite fragile. They can be squeezed gently. The eggs are translucent, so you can see the yolk, which, interestingly, always floats up.
If you drop a bare egg from a very low height (about 2-3 cm), it is likely to bounce like a rubber ball. (Be careful, it gets dirty and can burst!).

2,Re6IhsqOIv8,Life Probably Exists Beyond Earth - Space Science Documentary - Where Are We in the Universe?,"Since the beginning of civilization, humanity has wondered whether we are alone in the universe. As NASA has explored our solar system and beyond, it has developed increasingly sophisticated tools to address this fundamental question. Within our solar system, NASA‚Äôs missions have searched for signs of both ancient and current life, especially on Mars and soon, Jupiter‚Äôs moon Europa. Beyond our solar system, missions, such as Kepler and TESS, are revealing thousands of planets orbiting other stars. The explosion of knowledge of planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, and the results of decades of research on signatures of life - what scientists call biosignatures - have encouraged NASA to address, in a scientifically rigorous way, whether humanity is alone. Beyond searching for evidence of just microbial life, NASA now is exploring ways to search for life advanced enough to create technology.",Science and Technology

 Check out a collection of cool experiments that kids and grown-ups will totally love:
-    Bouncy egg experiment. Supplies you will need a glass of vinegar, marker core piece, and a raw egg. Remove a core piece from a marker and place into a glass of vinegar. Carefully place an egg into a glass. Leave the egg in the glass for 1 day. When the egg has started to become translucent, take it out of the glass. Your bouncy egg is ready. Check if it‚Äôs jumping
-    Check out if an egg is fresh. Place eggs in water. Old eggs will be on the top of the water.
-    Growing and shrinking eggs. Pour vinegar in a high glass and put an egg inside and leave for one day. The egg has become bigger and translucent. Take this egg and place in a glass full of maple syrup and wait for 1 day. The egg will shrink. After that place the same egg in a glass with water, also you can add some dye. And again, wait for a day. Check out the result!
-    Ink experiment. Make a drop of water and a drop of glue. Add one drop of ink to water and glue and watch the magic!
-    Racing spiders. Take a square piece of foil and draw a small spider with a marker. Pour water on the spider, take a straw and blow on a spider. Draw another spider and start racing! They are moving
-    Glowing slime. In a bowl, mix glue, fluorescent dye, sodium tetraborate
-    Make a ‚Äò‚Äôpillow‚Äô‚Äô for your hand if you work long hours at a desc. Mix starch with water and pour inside the balloon. Place this ‚Äúpillow‚Äù under your wrist for comfortable computer use.

The explosion of Supernova
According to the leading scientists, two stars will collide in the constellation cygnus. As a result, a supernova will occur, and a huge amount of energy will be ejected into space. It will be brighter that the light from a majority of stars in the galaxy. The consequences will be visible to the naked eye from the earth's surface. It will take place in 2022.

18,4i48EeMM1l0,25 SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS TO BLOW YOUR MIND,"Do you know that if you put an egg in vinegar for two days, the shell will dissolve and the egg will become elastic? Under the influence of vinegar, calcium, which makes up the shell, dissolves and disappears in the form of gas bubbles.  

Only the film between the shell and the egg remains intact. It turns out funny egg that looks like jelly. The egg increases slightly in size as it is saturated with vinegar. You can play with the egg as a ball. The film is very thin and, therefore, may be torn if handled carelessly. If you experiment with a boiled egg, it will become as elastic as a rubber ball. If you add a highlighter dye to vinegar, you will get a luminous elastic egg. 

I will show you how to make a similarity of crystals from sugar syrup and ice cubes. I'll show you a simple and very beautiful trick with soaring tea bags, we can call it ""Rocket Soaring"". When burning air heats up and rises up, forming a stream of hot air. When a bag burns and its weight becomes such that this flow can lift it, the light remnants of an almost burnt bag rise too.

Also look at the trick with a tennis ball and hairdryer, the trick with a candle, the trick with a balancing tin can, and others.

Have you ever heard about something that is unexplained? There are a lot of bizarre things in the world such as animals raining from the sky, or weird unexplained heat anomalies found inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. Sometimes the answer is found, and sometimes these things remain a mystery that science cannot explain. Check out these 10 Natural Phenomena that Science Can‚Äôt Explain. 

10. Mammatus clouds ‚Äì which means ""mammary cloud"", is a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud, these are typically heavy cumulonimbus rainclouds. Mammatus are most often associated with severe weather, and they can appear before or after a storm. 

9. 'Heat anomaly' found in Great Pyramid of Giza ‚Äì Scientists have been studying the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and have found strange heat signatures that have no explanation.

8. Oakville Blobs - On August 7, 1994 during a rainstorm, blobs of translucent gelatinous substance fell in the town of Oakville, Washington. Several attempts were made to identify the blobs. 

7. Lake Hillier, Australia - Australia is the home of unusual ‚Äòpink lakes‚Äô. Lake Hillier is one of them. Located on Middle Island, this body of water is famous for it‚Äôs remarkable bubble gum pink color. 600 meters long and surrounded by a rim of sand and thick woods of eucalyptus trees, this pink lake still surprises and intrigues scientists.

6. Socotra Island, Yemen - Want to feel like you‚Äôre visiting another planet? Check out Socotra Island off the coast of Yemen. It has been called the most alien-looking place on Earth, and a ‚Äòlost world‚Äô because the heat and drought conditions of the island have produced around 800 rare species of flora and fauna, and a third of those can‚Äôt be seen anywhere else on the planet. 

5. Kelimutu, Indonesia - Mount Kelimutu is a volcano in Flores, Indonesia. The mountain has three volcanic crater lakes that vary colors from each other at different times, making them surreal and exciting to be discovered. 

4. Brain Injury Turns Man Into Math Genius - After being brutally attacked in 2002, Jason Padgett now sees the world through a geometric lens. His devastating injury seems to have unlocked part of his brain that makes everything in his world appear to have a mathematical structure. 

3. Stonehenge - For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over Stonehenge, which took Neolithic builders around 1,500 years to build. Located in Southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout. 

2. Animal rain phenomenon - The origins of this bizarre animal rain phenomenon have evolved throughout history. The first reported phenomenon occurred in the first century AD, when Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented fish and frogs raining from the sky. 

1. Tsingy de Bemaraha, Madagascar - The Tsingy de Bemaraha is a national park located in the Melaky Region, northwest Madagascar. The site is unique with its biodiversity and exceptional landscape called the Tsingy - which can be translated into "" where one cannot walk barefoot"".",Science and Technology

10. The Piri Reis Map
In 1929, a German theologian was cataloging items in the Topkapi Palace Library in Istanbul, and he came across a gazelle skin parchment with an unusual map drawn onto it. Dated back to 1513, it was drawn and signed by Turkish cartographer Hagji Ahmed Muhiddin Piri, an admiral in the Turkish Navy at the time and the map is now known as the Piri Reis map. 

9. The Jehoash Inscription
In 2001, a group of Israeli archaeologists were shown a stone tablet, supposedly dating back to 1000 BC, with writing that describes repairs that were made to the temple of Solomon‚Ä¶ the first evidence ever to have been found about the renowned building. It underwent a series of tests, including radiocarbon dating, before being declared as a genuine artifact. 

8. Spanish Hill, Pennsylvania
Spanish Hill, in Pennsylvania, was first described by an explorer in 1795 who said it was ‚Äòthe shape of a sugar loaf, about 100 feet high, with a level top, on which are the remains of intrenchments'. Others saw the remains of walls, and further archaeological investigations have found potential evidence of a Native American society, including shell heaps, corn, flint chips, and various other implements.

7. How Alexander the Great Died
By 323 BC, Alexander the Great had secured an empire that stretched from the Balkans to modern day Pakistan, but his at the age of 32 that year has been a mystery ever since. He was on the verge of attacking another empire, when he became ill and, after 12 excruciating days, finally passed away.

6. Otzi
In 1991, the body of a 5,000-year-old mummy, now known as Otzi, was discovered by mountain climbers. The remains of the 45-year-old were remarkably well preserved, which has allowed researchers to examine in detail the causes of this. Despite this, there's a lot that remains unknown, and there's still great debate about how he met his end.

5. Tikal Temple 33
Tikal Temple 33 was a 108-foot-high Maya funerary pyramid that was found in the remains of the Maya city of Tikal, along with a number of other monuments. It was built in three different stages of construction in the year 457 when King Siyaj Chan K'awiil II's shrine was remodeled, and it's one of the most investigated structures of the city.

4. The Cyrus Cylinder
The Cyrus Cylinder is a clay cylinder which is inscribed in Akkadian cuneiform script. It was created in 539 BC on order of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the first Persian empire when he took control of Babylon.

3. The Sandia Cave
The Sandia Cave in Las Huertas Canyon, New Mexico, was once believed to be a place with vast evidence of the earliest inhabitants to live on the continent, but a set of events has led the archaeological community to question everything that they once thought to be true.

2. The Runamo Inscription
With ancient cultures having used symbols that we wouldn't necessarily recognize today, how would you know for sure whether something was actually written, or just occurred naturally? That's the question that's divided archaeologists in the case of the Runamo inscription, which is located near a church in Blekinge in southern Sweden.

1. The Talpiot Tomb
In 1980, a tomb was unearthed at a burial site in the Talpiot neighborhood of East Jerusalem, and inside there were 10 ossuaries‚Ä¶ some of which bore inscriptions that have been translated as saying ‚ÄòJesus son of Joseph‚Äô, ‚ÄòMary‚Äô, and a few other names associated with the New Testament. These names led some researchers to believe that this was the burial place of the family of Jesus of Nazareth, while many others rejected the idea, saying that these names were very common at the time.

10. The Ulfberht Swords
Ulfberht swords were the weapon of choice of the Vikings, along with other tribes around northern Europe. They had a long, double edged blade, and a straight crossbar over the grip. There are only about 170 still known to exist today, each of which dates to between the 9th and 11th centuries! And the cool thing is they have the tell-tale inscription in the blade itself.

9. The Drepanosaurus
Whenever a new fossil is found, it gives further clues as to the evolution of animals, and of those that once roamed the earth. Every now and then, though, something is found that makes no sense at all in terms of scientific understanding, and requires a complete re-think of what is taken as fact. This is exactly what‚Äôs happening with a little known creature, the Drepanosaurus.

8. Rat Kings
The Rat Kings are a rare phenomena from the animal kingdom that is so bizarre, no-one is entirely sure how it happens. You may have seen one before, but if you haven‚Äôt- they really are something quite unusual. They have been a part of legend for centuries, and are formed when a number of rats become attached by the tail.

7. The Martian Meteorite
In 1984, a meteorite fell to earth, something that in itself is no unusual thing. But this one, known as ALH84001, was found to hold secrets that no-one has been able to explain. The 4.1 billion-year-old rock is thought to have originated on Mars, having been dislodged during a collision, and floated through space until it fell into earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Unlike other similar specimens, the surface of this rock had something very unusual- what appeared to be the signs of fossilised bacteria. 

6. The Longyou Grottoes
The Longyou Grottoes are a series of underground structures near the village of Shiyan Beicun, in the Zhejiang province in China. They are thought to be at least 2000 years old, but scientists and researchers have no idea how they were built, what they were used for, or even who was responsible for them.

5. What was the first dinosaur?
Since we first realized that dinosaurs roamed the earth, palaeontologists have been trying to understand the full range of creatures that once lived, with particular interest revolving around which was the first dinosaur to ever live.

4. The Nampa Stone Doll
The Nampa figurine looks like any other that has been made by an ancient civilisation. The mystery surrounding this one, though, is how it came to be in the place where it was found. It was discovered in 1889 near the town of Nampa in Idaho. Workers were searching for water, and dug a well, which involved drilling a borehole to 295 feet. 

3. The Piri Reis Map
Today we take maps for granted. Satellite technology combined with the work of cartographers over the years, plus Google of course, have created incredibly detailed depictions of our planet. All we have to do is use our smartphone! This wasn‚Äôt always the way, clearly, and maps from centuries ago were just kind of close approximations based on ship voyages.

2. The Voynich Manuscript
The 600 year old Voynich manuscript is often thought of as being the most mysterious book that has ever been written, and still, to this day, scientists aren‚Äôt able to explain what‚Äôs inside. 

1. Dinosaur and Human Footprints
The final mystery is one which calls into question the idea that humans weren‚Äôt around at the time of the dinosaurs, because their footprints have been found side by side. The discovery was made in the Paluxy river, Texas, where hundreds of dinosaur footprints have been found. Their foot impressions were perfectly preserved by the river bed.

34,60JboffO,Rise and decline of science in Islam,"Support CaspianReport on Patreon:
https://www.patreon.com/CaspianReport

BAKU - With about 1.6 billion adherents, Islam is the second largest religion on Earth. Yet, its followers represent less than one percent of the world‚Äôs scientists. Only a handful of people from Muslim-majority countries have won Nobel Prizes in science.

However, up until the Mongol siege of Baghdad in 1258, Islamic science was the most advanced in the world. In comparison with the past, the modern disparity is staggering. Thus, to understand the present-day lack of scientific accomplishments, we must explore the past. In this instalment of a new series, we will go over the rise and decline of Islamic attitudes towards science.

Every Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

For over four and a half thousand years the pyramids of Egypt have stood as wonders of the world.  The facts are astonishing, the Great Pyramid alone weighs almost six million tons and contains over 2.3 million stone blocks.  Naked Science sets out to uncover four great mysteries that still surround the pyramids, how were they built, who built them, why were they built, and what secrets may still lie hidden within their stones.  As four millennia and countless generations stand between us and the men who built the pyramids we have to study the buildings themselves to uncover the answers. 

With British engineer Denys Stocks we learn the art of pyramid building.  Stocks has spent twenty years mastering the techniques used by the ancient workmen and shows how such vast quantities of stone were quarried, transported and fitted by a civilisation that had not even invented the wheel.  To show the scale of the achievement we asked construction manager and pyramid scholar Craig Smith to calculate what it would take to build a pyramid in today‚Äôs money.

We may know the names of the pharaohs who commissioned the pyramids but who actually hauled the blocks.  Legends have always held that slaves built the pyramids but we venture into the science of Forensic Egyptology to discover the truth.  Mark Lehner discovered the town of the pyramid builders while Zahi Hawass takes us on a tour of their tombs.

There may be few records of how the pyramids were built but hieroglyphic texts within some pyramids hint at their reveal purpose.  Salima Ikram and Jim Allen help us find for the reason why the pyramids were built within these spells and incantations.  However Robert Bauval, believes there may be deep connections between the pyramids and astronomy.  He believes links to the stars are hidden within their stones and chambers.

Finally we follow work in pyramid exploration as teams hunt for hidden chambers and use robots to explore the mysterious shafts at the centre of the Great Pyramid of Giza.",Science and Technology

In This Video We'll Show You About Time Travel.!!

The 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren't about what we experience in everyday life, but scientists have confirmed them.

Special Relativity also says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time, 

You might have seen time travel in Hollywood movies like Avengers End Game.. Let's see if that's possible or not..

43,6VYB3a9bbiA,24 CRAZY SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS YOU`VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE,"We have a lot of things stored in the kitchen, with which you can put interesting experiments for children. And for yourself to make a couple of discoveries and wonder why you never noticed this before? 
One of the most interesting experiments you can do at home is elastic eggs! You have no idea how that's possible? It's easy! This experiment is a classic example of an acid base reaction. This reaction dissolves the shell, but leaves the inner membrane intact, creating a bare egg.
Put the egg in a glass jar. Add vinegar. Pour enough vinegar to cover the egg, and a little more. First the eggs swim, but then they sink.
Watch the bubbles! Within a minute of adding vinegar, tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide appear on the eggshell. This is one part of the chemical reaction that takes place inside the jar.
Close the lid and leave for a few days, and can be a week. The egg will get a little bigger. The brown color of the eggshell pales. A layer of scale appears on the surface of the vinegar. You can replace the vinegar in a couple of days.
After a week, carefully remove the egg from the vinegar. Wash and wipe gently. You will see that the eggshell has become soft, it is pliable even with a light touch. It's like a naked egg!
Naked eggs are really cool. The inner membrane remains intact, so the eggs are quite fragile. They can be squeezed gently. The eggs are translucent, so you can see the yolk, which, interestingly, always floats up.
If you drop a bare egg from a very low height (about 2-3 cm), it is likely to bounce like a rubber ball. (Be careful, it gets dirty and can burst!).

45,Re6IhsqOIv8,Life Probably Exists Beyond Earth - Space Science Documentary - Where Are We in the Universe?,"Since the beginning of civilization, humanity has wondered whether we are alone in the universe. As NASA has explored our solar system and beyond, it has developed increasingly sophisticated tools to address this fundamental question. Within our solar system, NASA‚Äôs missions have searched for signs of both ancient and current life, especially on Mars and soon, Jupiter‚Äôs moon Europa. Beyond our solar system, missions, such as Kepler and TESS, are revealing thousands of planets orbiting other stars. The explosion of knowledge of planets orbiting other stars, called exoplanets, and the results of decades of research on signatures of life - what scientists call biosignatures - have encouraged NASA to address, in a scientifically rigorous way, whether humanity is alone. Beyond searching for evidence of just microbial life, NASA now is exploring ways to search for life advanced enough to create technology.",Science and Technology
46,OY6RgrDKQ,18 EASY SCHOOL MAGIC TRICKS AND SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS,"UNEXPECTED TRICKS AND IDEAS FOR KIDS

There are so many science tricks that you can perform at home without any problem! All you need is your hands and a few very affordable materials. Congratulations, you cna run your homemade science show and surprise your family members and friends! You can also use these tricks for your school project ideas.

For example, do you know how to get electricity out of a potato? If the answer was no, we are here to tell you how! You can also get electricty out of soda drinks.

Another amazing block of ideas is connected with batteries. For example, you can make a copper wire carousel out of a battery and a piece of wire. Another awesome idea that may come in handy at the most unexpected moment is charging phones using batteries ‚Äì check out our DIY science tutorial for kids and learn how to do that. 

It's getting colder ‚Äì you can make a portbale hand heater using a battery wrapped with a piece of foil. Another awesome (but you'll need supervision of your parents for this trick) is made with a battery and a couple of needles. 

Check out our cool magic tricks with magnets ‚Äì flying objects, spinning copper wire hoop, a rolling battery, a racing battery inside a copper spring, a water compass. You can make a lot of things using magnets. You can even make things levitate! Don't you believe me? Watch this video till the end and see yourself!

47,xctlaTmJ_zQ,22 CRAZY HOME SCIENCE TRICKS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN,"SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS FOR KIDS AND ADULTS

 Check out a collection of cool experiments that kids and grown-ups will totally love:
-    Bouncy egg experiment. Supplies you will need a glass of vinegar, marker core piece, and a raw egg. Remove a core piece from a marker and place into a glass of vinegar. Carefully place an egg into a glass. Leave the egg in the glass for 1 day. When the egg has started to become translucent, take it out of the glass. Your bouncy egg is ready. Check if it‚Äôs jumping
-    Check out if an egg is fresh. Place eggs in water. Old eggs will be on the top of the water.
-    Growing and shrinking eggs. Pour vinegar in a high glass and put an egg inside and leave for one day. The egg has become bigger and translucent. Take this egg and place in a glass full of maple syrup and wait for 1 day. The egg will shrink. After that place the same egg in a glass with water, also you can add some dye. And again, wait for a day. Check out the result!
-    Ink experiment. Make a drop of water and a drop of glue. Add one drop of ink to water and glue and watch the magic!
-    Racing spiders. Take a square piece of foil and draw a small spider with a marker. Pour water on the spider, take a straw and blow on a spider. Draw another spider and start racing! They are moving
-    Glowing slime. In a bowl, mix glue, fluorescent dye, sodium tetraborate
-    Make a ‚Äò‚Äôpillow‚Äô‚Äô for your hand if you work long hours at a desc. Mix starch with water and pour inside the balloon. Place this ‚Äúpillow‚Äù under your wrist for comfortable computer use.

Watch the video till end and find more cool experiments for a boring evening!

The explosion of Supernova
According to the leading scientists, two stars will collide in the constellation cygnus. As a result, a supernova will occur, and a huge amount of energy will be ejected into space. It will be brighter that the light from a majority of stars in the galaxy. The consequences will be visible to the naked eye from the earth's surface. It will take place in 2022.

61,4i48EeMM1l0,25 SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS TO BLOW YOUR MIND,"Do you know that if you put an egg in vinegar for two days, the shell will dissolve and the egg will become elastic? Under the influence of vinegar, calcium, which makes up the shell, dissolves and disappears in the form of gas bubbles.  

Only the film between the shell and the egg remains intact. It turns out funny egg that looks like jelly. The egg increases slightly in size as it is saturated with vinegar. You can play with the egg as a ball. The film is very thin and, therefore, may be torn if handled carelessly. If you experiment with a boiled egg, it will become as elastic as a rubber ball. If you add a highlighter dye to vinegar, you will get a luminous elastic egg. 

I will show you how to make a similarity of crystals from sugar syrup and ice cubes. I'll show you a simple and very beautiful trick with soaring tea bags, we can call it ""Rocket Soaring"". When burning air heats up and rises up, forming a stream of hot air. When a bag burns and its weight becomes such that this flow can lift it, the light remnants of an almost burnt bag rise too.

Also look at the trick with a tennis ball and hairdryer, the trick with a candle, the trick with a balancing tin can, and others.

Have you ever heard about something that is unexplained? There are a lot of bizarre things in the world such as animals raining from the sky, or weird unexplained heat anomalies found inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. Sometimes the answer is found, and sometimes these things remain a mystery that science cannot explain. Check out these 10 Natural Phenomena that Science Can‚Äôt Explain. 

10. Mammatus clouds ‚Äì which means ""mammary cloud"", is a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud, these are typically heavy cumulonimbus rainclouds. Mammatus are most often associated with severe weather, and they can appear before or after a storm. 

9. 'Heat anomaly' found in Great Pyramid of Giza ‚Äì Scientists have been studying the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and have found strange heat signatures that have no explanation.

8. Oakville Blobs - On August 7, 1994 during a rainstorm, blobs of translucent gelatinous substance fell in the town of Oakville, Washington. Several attempts were made to identify the blobs. 

7. Lake Hillier, Australia - Australia is the home of unusual ‚Äòpink lakes‚Äô. Lake Hillier is one of them. Located on Middle Island, this body of water is famous for it‚Äôs remarkable bubble gum pink color. 600 meters long and surrounded by a rim of sand and thick woods of eucalyptus trees, this pink lake still surprises and intrigues scientists.

6. Socotra Island, Yemen - Want to feel like you‚Äôre visiting another planet? Check out Socotra Island off the coast of Yemen. It has been called the most alien-looking place on Earth, and a ‚Äòlost world‚Äô because the heat and drought conditions of the island have produced around 800 rare species of flora and fauna, and a third of those can‚Äôt be seen anywhere else on the planet. 

5. Kelimutu, Indonesia - Mount Kelimutu is a volcano in Flores, Indonesia. The mountain has three volcanic crater lakes that vary colors from each other at different times, making them surreal and exciting to be discovered. 

4. Brain Injury Turns Man Into Math Genius - After being brutally attacked in 2002, Jason Padgett now sees the world through a geometric lens. His devastating injury seems to have unlocked part of his brain that makes everything in his world appear to have a mathematical structure. 

3. Stonehenge - For centuries, historians and archaeologists have puzzled over Stonehenge, which took Neolithic builders around 1,500 years to build. Located in Southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout. 

2. Animal rain phenomenon - The origins of this bizarre animal rain phenomenon have evolved throughout history. The first reported phenomenon occurred in the first century AD, when Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented fish and frogs raining from the sky. 

1. Tsingy de Bemaraha, Madagascar - The Tsingy de Bemaraha is a national park located in the Melaky Region, northwest Madagascar.

10. The Piri Reis Map
In 1929, a German theologian was cataloging items in the Topkapi Palace Library in Istanbul, and he came across a gazelle skin parchment with an unusual map drawn onto it. Dated back to 1513, it was drawn and signed by Turkish cartographer Hagji Ahmed Muhiddin Piri, an admiral in the Turkish Navy at the time and the map is now known as the Piri Reis map. 

9. The Jehoash Inscription
In 2001, a group of Israeli archaeologists were shown a stone tablet, supposedly dating back to 1000 BC, with writing that describes repairs that were made to the temple of Solomon‚Ä¶ the first evidence ever to have been found about the renowned building. It underwent a series of tests, including radiocarbon dating, before being declared as a genuine artifact. 

8. Spanish Hill, Pennsylvania
Spanish Hill, in Pennsylvania, was first described by an explorer in 1795 who said it was ‚Äòthe shape of a sugar loaf, about 100 feet high, with a level top, on which are the remains of intrenchments'. Others saw the remains of walls, and further archaeological investigations have found potential evidence of a Native American society, including shell heaps, corn, flint chips, and various other implements.

7. How Alexander the Great Died
By 323 BC, Alexander the Great had secured an empire that stretched from the Balkans to modern day Pakistan, but his at the age of 32 that year has been a mystery ever since. He was on the verge of attacking another empire, when he became ill and, after 12 excruciating days, finally passed away.

6. Otzi
In 1991, the body of a 5,000-year-old mummy, now known as Otzi, was discovered by mountain climbers. The remains of the 45-year-old were remarkably well preserved, which has allowed researchers to examine in detail the causes of this. Despite this, there's a lot that remains unknown, and there's still great debate about how he met his end.

5. Tikal Temple 33
Tikal Temple 33 was a 108-foot-high Maya funerary pyramid that was found in the remains of the Maya city of Tikal, along with a number of other monuments. It was built in three different stages of construction in the year 457 when King Siyaj Chan K'awiil II's shrine was remodeled, and it's one of the most investigated structures of the city.

4. The Cyrus Cylinder
The Cyrus Cylinder is a clay cylinder which is inscribed in Akkadian cuneiform script. It was created in 539 BC on order of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the first Persian empire when he took control of Babylon.

3. The Sandia Cave
The Sandia Cave in Las Huertas Canyon, New Mexico, was once believed to be a place with vast evidence of the earliest inhabitants to live on the continent, but a set of events has led the archaeological community to question everything that they once thought to be true.

2. The Runamo Inscription
With ancient cultures having used symbols that we wouldn't necessarily recognize today, how would you know for sure whether something was actually written, or just occurred naturally? That's the question that's divided archaeologists in the case of the Runamo inscription, which is located near a church in Blekinge in southern Sweden.

1. The Talpiot Tomb
In 1980, a tomb was unearthed at a burial site in the Talpiot neighborhood of East Jerusalem, and inside there were 10 ossuaries‚Ä¶ some of which bore inscriptions that have been translated as saying ‚ÄòJesus son of Joseph‚Äô, ‚ÄòMary‚Äô, and a few other names associated with the New Testament. These names led some researchers to believe that this was the burial place of the family of Jesus of Nazareth, while many others rejected the idea, saying that these names were very common at the time.

10. The Ulfberht Swords
Ulfberht swords were the weapon of choice of the Vikings, along with other tribes around northern Europe. They had a long, double edged blade, and a straight crossbar over the grip. There are only about 170 still known to exist today, each of which dates to between the 9th and 11th centuries! And the cool thing is they have the tell-tale inscription in the blade itself.

9. The Drepanosaurus
Whenever a new fossil is found, it gives further clues as to the evolution of animals, and of those that once roamed the earth. Every now and then, though, something is found that makes no sense at all in terms of scientific understanding, and requires a complete re-think of what is taken as fact. This is exactly what‚Äôs happening with a little known creature, the Drepanosaurus.

8. Rat Kings
The Rat Kings are a rare phenomena from the animal kingdom that is so bizarre, no-one is entirely sure how it happens. You may have seen one before, but if you haven‚Äôt- they really are something quite unusual. They have been a part of legend for centuries, and are formed when a number of rats become attached by the tail.

7. The Martian Meteorite
In 1984, a meteorite fell to earth, something that in itself is no unusual thing. But this one, known as ALH84001, was found to hold secrets that no-one has been able to explain. The 4.1 billion-year-old rock is thought to have originated on Mars, having been dislodged during a collision, and floated through space until it fell into earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Unlike other similar specimens, the surface of this rock had something very unusual- what appeared to be the signs of fossilised bacteria. 

6. The Longyou Grottoes
The Longyou Grottoes are a series of underground structures near the village of Shiyan Beicun, in the Zhejiang province in China. They are thought to be at least 2000 years old, but scientists and researchers have no idea how they were built, what they were used for, or even who was responsible for them.

5. What was the first dinosaur?
Since we first realized that dinosaurs roamed the earth, palaeontologists have been trying to understand the full range of creatures that once lived, with particular interest revolving around which was the first dinosaur to ever live.

4. The Nampa Stone Doll
The Nampa figurine looks like any other that has been made by an ancient civilisation. The mystery surrounding this one, though, is how it came to be in the place where it was found. It was discovered in 1889 near the town of Nampa in Idaho. Workers were searching for water, and dug a well, which involved drilling a borehole to 295 feet. 

3. The Piri Reis Map
Today we take maps for granted. Satellite technology combined with the work of cartographers over the years, plus Google of course, have created incredibly detailed depictions of our planet. All we have to do is use our smartphone! This wasn‚Äôt always the way, clearly, and maps from centuries ago were just kind of close approximations based on ship voyages.

2. The Voynich Manuscript
The 600 year old Voynich manuscript is often thought of as being the most mysterious book that has ever been written, and still, to this day, scientists aren‚Äôt able to explain what‚Äôs inside. 

1. Dinosaur and Human Footprints
The final mystery is one which calls into question the idea that humans weren‚Äôt around at the time of the dinosaurs, because their footprints have been found side by side. The discovery was made in the Paluxy river, Texas, where hundreds of dinosaur footprints have been found. Their foot impressions were perfectly preserved by the river bed.

77,60JboffO,Rise and decline of science in Islam,"Support CaspianReport on Patreon:
https://www.patreon.com/CaspianReport

BAKU - With about 1.6 billion adherents, Islam is the second largest religion on Earth. Yet, its followers represent less than one percent of the world‚Äôs scientists. Only a handful of people from Muslim-majority countries have won Nobel Prizes in science.

However, up until the Mongol siege of Baghdad in 1258, Islamic science was the most advanced in the world. In comparison with the past, the modern disparity is staggering. Thus, to understand the present-day lack of scientific accomplishments, we must explore the past. In this instalment of a new series, we will go over the rise and decline of Islamic attitudes towards science.

78,FnMCIrKRkQM,Naked Science - Pyramids,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

For over four and a half thousand years the pyramids of Egypt have stood as wonders of the world.  The facts are astonishing, the Great Pyramid alone weighs almost six million tons and contains over 2.3 million stone blocks.  Naked Science sets out to uncover four great mysteries that still surround the pyramids, how were they built, who built them, why were they built, and what secrets may still lie hidden within their stones.  As four millennia and countless generations stand between us and the men who built the pyramids we have to study the buildings themselves to uncover the answers. 

With British engineer Denys Stocks we learn the art of pyramid building.  Stocks has spent twenty years mastering the techniques used by the ancient workmen and shows how such vast quantities of stone were quarried, transported and fitted by a civilisation that had not even invented the wheel.  To show the scale of the achievement we asked construction manager and pyramid scholar Craig Smith to calculate what it would take to build a pyramid in today‚Äôs money.

We may know the names of the pharaohs who commissioned the pyramids but who actually hauled the blocks.  Legends have always held that slaves built the pyramids but we venture into the science of Forensic Egyptology to discover the truth.  Mark Lehner discovered the town of the pyramid builders while Zahi Hawass takes us on a tour of their tombs.

There may be few records of how the pyramids were built but hieroglyphic texts within some pyramids hint at their reveal purpose.  Salima Ikram and Jim Allen help us find for the reason why the pyramids were built within these spells and incantations.  However Robert Bauval, believes there may be deep connections between the pyramids and astronomy.  He believes links to the stars are hidden within their stones and chambers.

Finally we follow work in pyramid exploration as teams hunt for hidden chambers and use robots to explore the mysterious shafts at the centre of the Great Pyramid of Giza.",Science and Technology

In This Video We'll Show You About Time Travel.!!

The 20th century scientist Albert Einstein developed a theory called Special Relativity. The ideas of Special Relativity are very hard to imagine because they aren't about what we experience in everyday life, but scientists have confirmed them.

Special Relativity also says that a surprising thing happens when you move through space-time, 

You might have seen time travel in Hollywood movies like Avengers End Game.. Let's see if that's possible or not..

89,K01IxL8y_eI,Dr. Brian Keating ‚Äî Losing the Nobel Prize (SCIENCE SALON # 70),"We apologize for the very poor audio-video quality of this recording.

Listen to the Podcast (audio) version:


A Story of Cosmology, Ambition, and the Perils of Science‚Äôs Highest Honor

In this wide-ranging conversation Science Salon host Dr. Michael Shermer speaks with cosmologist and inventor of the BICEP (Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization) experiment Dr. Brian Keating about the following topics:

‚Ä¢ how he almost won the Nobel Prize for his research that confirmed the inflationary model of the Big Bang
‚Ä¢ the problems with the Nobel Prize as it is currently structured, such as its limitation to only three people (when modern experiments are typically directed by a great many more); that it can‚Äôt be awarded posthumously (thereby neglecting people like Amos Tversky, who did as much work as his Nobel Prize-winning collaborator Daniel Kahneman); its neglect of many women scientists as deserving of the prize as their male counterparts, and especially how it distorts incentives to collaborate in science
‚Ä¢ his upbringing and what inspired him to probe the deepest questions about the nature of the cosmos and reality
‚Ä¢ what it‚Äôs like conducting research in the harsh conditions at the South Pole
‚Ä¢ what banged in the Big Bang and what there was before the Big Bang
‚Ä¢ the possibility (or not) of a multiverse model and a cyclical model of universes outside of, or before, our universe
‚Ä¢ the relationship between science and religion and why they need not always be in conflict
‚Ä¢ his Prager U video on why believing in the multiverse takes as much faith as believing in God.

This dialogue was recorded on May 21, 2019 as part of the Science Salon Podcast series hosted by Michael Shermer and presented by The Skeptics Society, in California.

Scientists are trying to solve historical enigmas and puzzles, but there's still a lot of unexplainable facts in history. Mysteries, ancient legends, curses and fantastic artifacts keep bewildering scientists all over the world... Even in the 21st century, there are many stories like this. Today, you will hear some of them. Perhaps you will be able to solve the mysteries that the greatest researchers couldn't?",Science and Technology
93,G1pa6afh8o4,Naked Science - Super Volcanoes,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Yellowstone, Wyoming.  In spring 2003, strange things began happening in America's most famous national park.  The tallest geyser in the world, which can go 50 years without erupting, burst into life.  Spraying columns of superheated water, 100s of feet into the air.  There were new cracks in the ground, the ground heated up to the point where the National Park Service had to close some trails.  Not long after, a group of bison collapsed and died, victims of poisonous fumes from below the ground.  Satellite pictures revealed that something ominous was happening beneath the earth.  On the internet, unfounded rumours spread that a super volcano, an eruption so large, that it only occurs on average every 700,000 years, was about to blow.  These things happen, you can look at the earth and see the scars.  They happen, and they're going to happen again.

A million times more powerful than Hiroshima, super volcanoes are real events.  Over 20 have been recorded in the history of the earth and over half of these happened in the USA.  For the last 30 years scientists have been investigating where the next super volcano could erupt.  Their research has revealed that an active super volcano exists under Yellowstone National Park.  Naked Science follows these scientists and investigates the vital question, if the Yellowstone Caldera erupted today, could we survive?  This documentary includes a Yellowstone timeline of past eruptions, how Yellowstone would affect the world, and what impact will it be for the United States.",Science and Technology

95,DuFyGHgGIKg,Physicist Breaks Down The Science Of 10 Iconic Marvel Scenes,"To celebrate the release of ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame,‚Äù we had physicist (and lifelong comic book fan) Jim Kakalios take a closer look at the physics of the Marvel universe. Here he reacts to 10 memorable scenes from Marvel movies and rates them based on their accuracy. Find out what exactly quantum mechanics, time dilation, Einstein‚Äôs theory of special relativity, and spider silk tell us about the superheroes of the Marvel franchise.

Which weapon would you rather have in a fight: Thor‚Äôs Mjolnir hammer or Captain America‚Äôs shield? Hint: The answer has to do with the conservation of energy ‚Äî and the sonoluminescence of vibranium. Dr. Kakalios breaks down the physics behind this and many other Marvel phenomena, including Shuri‚Äôs holographic car in ‚ÄúBlack Panther;‚Äù  Peter Parker‚Äôs spider-webbing train save in ‚ÄúSpider-Man 2;‚Äù the multiverse theory of ‚ÄúDoctor Strange;‚Äù the role of Pym particles and the Higgs boson in ‚ÄúAnt-Man;‚Äù artificial gravity in ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy;‚Äù and Tony Stark‚Äôs cybernetic helmet and gold-titanium exoskeleton in ‚ÄúIron Man.‚Äù He sheds light on why Carol Danvers doesn‚Äôt age from ‚ÄúCaptain Marvel‚Äù to ‚ÄúAvengers: Endgame;‚Äù why the Space Stone is so powerful when yielded by Thanos in ‚ÄúAvengers: Infinity War;‚Äù and what‚Äôs with all the talk of quantum entanglement, quantum tunneling, and ‚Äúquantum mumbo-jumbo‚Äù in ‚ÄúAnt-Man and the Wasp.‚Äù

Kakalios is the author of three books ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Physics of Superheroes,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Physics of Everyday Things,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Amazing Story of Quantum Mechanics.‚Äù He was a science consultant for Sony‚Äôs 2012 film ‚ÄúThe Amazing Spider-Man.‚Äù Before that, he won an Emmy for his work as a science consultant for the Warner Bros. superhero film ‚ÄúWatchmen.‚Äù A physics professor at the University of Minnesota, Kakalios teaches a popular class that uses comic books to illustrate the principles of physics.

The year was 1908, and the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski had been trying to make sense of Albert Einstein‚Äôs hot new idea ‚Äì what we now know as special relativity ‚Äì describing how things shrink as they move faster and time becomes distorted. ‚ÄúHenceforth space by itself and time by itself are doomed to fade into the mere shadows,‚Äù Minkowski proclaimed, ‚Äúand only a union of the two will preserve an independent reality.‚Äù

And so space-time ‚Äì the malleable fabric whose geometry can be changed by the gravity of stars, planets and matter ‚Äì was born. It is a concept that has served us well, but if physicist Petr Horava is right, it may be no more than a mirage. Horava, who is at the University of California, Berkeley, wants to rip this fabric apart and set time and space free from one another in order to come up with a unified theory that reconciles the disparate worlds of quantum mechanics and gravity ‚Äì one the most pressing challenges to modern physics.

Since Horava published his work in January 2009, it has received an astonishing amount of attention. Already, more than 250 papers have been written about it. Some researchers have started using it to explain away the twin cosmological mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. Others are finding that black holes might not behave as we thought.

John Stossel points out that people on the right are more likely to believe in creationism.

Tierney answers, ‚Äúcreationism doesn't‚Ä¶ affect the way science is done. I can't find examples where the right-wing stopped the progress of science‚Ä¶ whereas you can look on the left and you see so many areas that are taboo to research.‚Äù

Gender differences, IQ trends, genetically modified foods. Tierney says the left stifled research into what could have been a second Green Revolution to feed Africa.

People who study gender difference have leaned to keep quiet, says Tierney. ‚ÄúYou can't say that there are more men are more aggressive, more risk-taking, that status matters and making money matters more to them.‚Äù

Finally, Tierney complains that Universities are utterly dominated by leftists. In the social sciences, Democrats outnumber Republicans by at least eight to one.  In some fields like sociology it's 44 to one. Students are more likely to be taught in sociology by a Marxist [25%]  than by a Republican [2%].

Tierney says ‚Äúonce an academic department gets a majority of people who are on the left, they start hiring people like themselves, and pretty soon the whole department is that way. They start to think that their opinions and that their interests are not only the norm, but the truth.‚Äù

Transcript - We all want to have a good stable relationship with somebody and one of the problems with early stage intense feelings of romantic love is that it‚Äôs part of the oldest parts of the brain that become activated. Brain regions linked with drive, with craving, with obsession, with motivation. And in fact some cognitive regions up I the prefrontal cortex that have evolved much more recently begin to shut down. Brain regions linked with decision making, planning ahead, you know, people who are madly in love can fall madly in love with somebody who‚Äôs married who lives on the other side of the planet, who comes from a different religion and somehow they‚Äôll say to themselves we‚Äôll work it out. We can work this out because of all that energy of intense romantic love and also the shutting down of various brain systems like with decision making. So one of the things that I say to people is, you know, before you decide to marry somebody spend some, a good deal of time with them so that some of that early stage intense feelings of romantic love can begin to subside and you can begin to really see what you‚Äôve got. As a matter of fact I‚Äôm very optimistic about the future of relationships because we‚Äôre spending so much time now getting to know somebody before we wed. You know a great many people are having these one night stands and friends with benefits and living together before they marry. And there was a recent study in which they asked a lot of single people who were living together with somebody why have they not yet married. And 67 percent were terrified of divorce, terrified of the ‚Äì not only the legal and the financial and the economic but the personal and social fallout of divorce. And so I began to realize maybe all of this hooking up and friends with benefits and living together is not recklessness. Maybe it‚Äôs caution. Maybe singles are trying to learn every single thing they can about a potential partner before they tie the knot.   Read Full Transcript Here:  ",Science and Technology

114,ViZNgU-Yt-Y,9 Awesome Science Tricks Using Static Electricity!,"Add me on Facebook. (click the LIKE button on Facebook to add me) http://www.facebook.com/brusspup

Music in the video are songs I created.

Song #1: Over Rain

Song #2 Soul Switch Remix - Will be available soon

All of these tricks take advantage of static electricity. In general, the lower the humidity, the better these tricks will work. The most impressive one to me is the floating bag trick. Depending on the conditions, you can float an entire grocery sack. 

1. Hover Plate: (You need Styrofoam Plates and a cloth) Styrofoam plates are great for static electricity tricks. When you give them a charge and hold one above the other, you can feel an incredible amount of resistance.

2. Can Can Go (You need a coke can, PVC pipe and a cloth) This is a classic but still fun. Try standing the can up and then tip it over with static, or try pulling 2 cans at the same time.

3. Stick Around (You need a small wooden stick, glass jar, thread, tape, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is fun because half of the time the wooden stick will come toward the pvc pipe, and other times it will move away from the pipe. When it moves away, it will stick the the side of the jar and remain there for a period of time. It also fun to use as large a jar as possible to increase the dramatic effect of the pipe moving the stick from such a large distance.

4. Bubble Trouble (You need bubble solution, plexi-glass, PVC pipe, straw and a cloth. This is a fun trick because the bubbles change their shape and move when the pvc pipe is near. It's also fun to create bubbles inside of bubbles to watch the effect of the static electricity. And also create multiple bubbles on the sheet and watch them all travel toward the pipe.

5. Dancing Balls (You need styrofoam balls, aluminum foil, plexi-glass, cloth, and an area to keep the balls from escaping. This trick is really impressive but can be a bit difficult to recreate. When the plexi-glass plate is charged and placed over the balls, they all jump up and stick to the bottom of the glass. For a few moments they travel around sporadically until they finally settle. But when you put your finger near the glass, they all start jumping around. It's also fun to use these balls with styrofoam plates / cups. If you place the ball on a charged plate, it will shoot off of the plate, or stick to it, even if the plate is held sideways or upside down.

6. Water Bender (You need a cup that you can poke a hole in,  water, PVC pipe and a cloth. This is  a classic but still fun. 

7. Balloon Fight (You need balloons, thread, PVC pipe and cloth. When the conditions are just right, the balloon can almost levitate about the pipe. But most of the time you can have fun pushing the balloons around with the charged pipe.

8. Electroscope (You need, steel wire, jar, straw, aluminum foil, PVC pipe and a cloth) This one is really impressive to see in person. A really cool effect to try, which you can see in this video, is to rub the cloth on the pvc pipe from several feet away from the jar. When you run the pipe, you can see the aluminum foil pieces in the jar, moving. I was able to stand as far as 5 feet away and still see the effect.

9. Wingardium Leviosa (You need very light weight / thin plastic bags, cloth, PVC pipe) This is my favorite trick. Again, with the correct conditions, you can get the plastic pieces  to float over foot above the pipe. Produce bags from the grocery store work great. You can float an entire produce bag in the right conditions.

132,JWtsOiVxIIE,Physics marble track review part one // Homemade Science with Bruce Yeany,"track material is easy to work with and cheap.  it is called shelf bracket tracks or shelf uprights.  I have seen various hardware stores and building supply stores carry it,  one company that makes it is   Rubbermaid. E5 shelf upright. available at Home Depot, Last time I checked,   Lowes does not carry it

      

Introduction song. is an Apple jingle found in the iMovie media files,  the title is called ""catwalk,  medium""

One last note, I've had some comments on me  mispronouncing height as heighth.  My possible responses:

1.  sometimes I get nervous in front of the camera and have moments where my brain shuts down. 

2. We grew up pronouncing it that way.

3. We all make mistakes.....but is it really a mistake ?

4..  Merriam Webster dictionary to my rescue- Heighth- expressed as a dialectal variant of the word height.   Part that rises or extends upwards,  the highest part",Science and Technology

148,J4Ngqj5wO0,Naked Science - Loch Ness,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Naked Science investigates the truth behind the legend.

The legend of the Loch Ness monster dates back 1500 years.  Since then, 1000 eye witnesses, countless photographs, sonar records and films have testified to the existence of a Loch Ness monster.  Yet despite extensive exploration, observation and scientific analysis, still no real evidence has been discovered.

This documentary starts off charting the early history of the legend.  From the first sighting by St Columba in 565AD, to the ‚ÄòSpicer‚Äô sighting that kicked off the modern legend in 1933 and the world famous ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô from 1934 that captured what appeared to be a head and neck emerging from Loch Ness.  From the ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô, the press, frenzied public and scientific observers soon concluded that the creature living in the loch was a long-extinct dinosaur called a plesiosaur.  A preposterous suggestion it would seem.  However Naked Science profiles the coelacanth.  A fish thought to be extinct 80 million years ago but discovered in 1938, to much surprise, living off the coast of Madagascar.

But even if it was a dinosaur from the Triassic period, how on earth did it get into the loch?   Loch Ness was gouged into today‚Äôs U shape valley by a series of glaciers that last melted 11,000 years ago, long after the extinction of the dinosaurs.  Naked Science profiles the geology of the loch and examines whether the sea has ever intruded into the loch perhaps carrying an unknown creature in with it.

After decades of intense observation of the surface of the loch by volunteer monster-hunters from around the world, in the late 60s Adrian Shine, skeptic, naturalist and leader of the Loch Ness Project arrived on the scene.  He took a different tactic.  Rather than search for a big monster, he looked for creatures just 100th of an inch in diameter, zooplankton.  A monster brood hiding out in the loch would need plenty of zooplankton, to support plenty of fish, who in turn could support large creatures.  Naked Science examines this ecology for clues.  We also discover there are internal waves called seiches, mirages, local wildlife, large fish such as sturgeon, floating logs, boat wakes and strong winds that could all have their place in provoking monster sightings.

But what of all the photographic evidence?  The most famous moving image of the Loch Ness monster is the so-called Dinsdale film of 1960.  At the time Britain‚Äôs foremost photographic analysis experts concluded it was an animate creature.  Using high spec imagery analysis we show how the famous Dinsdale film was most probably a helmsman in a boat.  Likewise we demonstrate that the McNab photo of 1955 could also be a boat wake.  Naked Science reveals that the notorious ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô was actually a hoax.  We show how in 1933 big game-hunter Marmaduke Wetherell planted some footprints on the loch side and passed them off as the monster.  Humiliated when his first hoax was discovered, Wetherell‚Äôs revenge was the ‚ÄòSurgeon‚Äôs Photo‚Äô.  In a reconstruction, we show how easy it was for him to fabricate a monster from a toy submarine and reveal how the hoax remained a secret for 50 years.  Finally we look at the most unique theory by Italian geologist Dr Piccardi, that earth tremors along the Great Glen fault provoke water disturbance that are mistaken for monsters thrashing around in the water.",Science and Technology
149,Er9D00DXQQ,Science Has Found Proof of the Existence of God!,"How to be Saved from Hell:

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10:9

For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. John 

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: Romans 8 

For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 

For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Ephesians 2

155,0tqgWuSIZUg,Naked Science - Moon Mysteries,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

The moon is far more than just a beautiful object in the night sky.

Ever since its creation 4.5 billion years ago the moon has been edging away from Earth into space.  Throughout its journey, it has influenced our planet in different ways.  But one things clear, without it life would never have emerged on Earth.

4.5 billion years ago the moon forms when another planet slams into the early Earth.  The impact knocks our planet ‚Äúoff-balance‚Äù onto an axis of 23 degrees, which we still rotate around today.  This is what gives us our seasons.  Without it we would have no summers, springs, winters or falls.

4 billion years ago the solar system endures the most violent meteorite bombardment in its history, the Lunar Cataclysm.  The Earth, being 50 times bigger than the moon, exerts a massive gravitational pull on incoming space debris.  Because the moon is still so close to Earth it too gets hit.  99% of all craters on the lunar surface visible today are a result of this bombardment.

3 billion years ago the Earth has water and oceans.  Because the moon is far closer its gravitational pull is far stronger on the Earth.  The tides it creates are thousands of feet high and smash hundreds of miles inland every day.  Scientists believe that these tides feed the Primordial Soup with the minerals required to start life.  Without them only the most basic microbes would be on Earth today.

Today the moon has the same gravitational pull as a mosquito landing on your head, yet some people still believe it can influence our planet in bizarre ways.

The San Francisco Police Department tell us how crime appears to soar during a full moon.  But the scientific data suggests otherwise, studies show no correlation between the Full Moon and violence.  Naked Science investigates.

Scientific research into the moon is allowing some scientists to predict when natural disasters will strike.  Some researchers believe that when the sun and moon align and pull together on the Earth they can trigger both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

In the future the moon will move so far from Earth that it will affect the fine balance of our planet, sending our climate tumbling out of control.",Science and Technology

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Landslides are among the most deadly of nature‚Äôs awesome forces, the raw power of our planet at its most overwhelming.  Throughout history they have taken a terrible toll in human life and property destruction.  Science is doing what little it can to find out what causes landslides and to predict or prevent such disasters. But, ironically, it is often the actions of humans and our desire to live in areas of great scenic beauty that make the dangers and the effects of landslides even worse.

Naked Science follows the landslide detectives, such as geologist Randy Jibson, who investigates the cause of a 2005 landslide in the Californian town of La Conchita.  He characterises the disaster as a ‚Äúslide‚Äù type of land movement, a mass of mud and earth dragged downslope as a single cohesive mass by the overwhelming power of gravity.

Such events often move slowly; but at la Conchita the slide moved faster than a person could run, wiping out more than a dozen homes and killing ten residents.  Jibson‚Äôs enquires eventually uncover a fault line in the hillside allowing water to flow through the hill and fatally weaken the slope.

A second investigation looks into the cause of Australia‚Äôs worst ever landslide in village of Threadbo, New South Wales.  More than 2000 cubic metres of mud and rock smashed through three ski-lodges and buried 20 people.  It was Australia‚Äôs worst-ever landslide.  The film tells the story of ski-instructor Stuart Diver, the only survivor, who was found under the wreckage three days later lying alongside the dead body of his young wife.  Naked Science reveals how the cause was finally traced to a leaking water pipe saturating the ground.

Scientists at research centres in Oregon in the USA and at Davos in Switzerland, show how they are developing lightweight netting protection to guard against the dangers of rock falls.  But such systems would have been of little use at Yosemite Park in California where two massive rocks 350 times as heavy as the Statue of Liberty, crashed in freefall 3000 feet down a mountainside to kill and injure people at a nearby nature centre.

Finally Naked Science looks to the future, examining the scientific controversy over a landslide yet-to-happen in the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa.  Some scientists believe that the entire mountain side of the volcanic island of La Palma could collapse into the sea in a future eruption.  The landslide would send a massive tsunami across the Atlantic Ocean to wipe out East Coast America in a tsunami dwarfing even the horrors of the 2004 Asian tidal-wave disaster.  Naked Science predicts that if and when this happens it could be the most deadly landslide ever witnessed by man.",Science and Technology

You‚Äôd be surprised to find out what crazy inventions existed back then that science still can‚Äôt explain today.  If you‚Äôre ready to learn more about these mind-blowing ancient inventions plus a whole lot more, then keep on watching.

SUMMARY
-Granodiorite rocks can easily be carved using temperature techniques. Hundreds of stone spheres were found quarried in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. Researchers even saw a gigantic ball weighing over 16 tons.
-The Roman dodecahedron had 12 flat pentagon-shaped faces with a knob protruding on each corner. It might have been a dice, a kid‚Äôs toy, a candle holder, a simple decoration, a measuring device on the battlefield, or an astronomical instrument, to name a few.
-The Phaistos Disk was made from clay and measures about 6.2 inches in diameter. Experts concluded that it was a prayer to an ancient Minoan goddess.
-The formula of Greek fire was a well-guarded state secret for over 7 centuries. Greek fire was used in naval warfare.
-Blades made from Damascus steel were the most sought after in medieval Europe. And that‚Äôs because they were the best swords at the time.
-The Iron pillar of Delhi dates back to the Gupta period, which lasted from about 240 to 590 C.E. A small amount of rust has started to form, but it is strange that there isn‚Äôt more.
-Viking Ulfberht swords are believed to have been made around 800 to 1,000 C.E., but experts were sure that the technology used to make swords of such extraordinary quality didn‚Äôt come around until 800 years later.
-The Voynich manuscript has 240 pages broken up into four sections: herbal, astrological, balneological, and pharmacological. There have literally been dozens of failed attempts to crack this thing.
-In 132 C.E., Zhang Heng, a Chinese inventor, astronomer, engineer, scientist, scholar, and artist, invented a seismoscope and presented it to the Han court as an instrument for measuring seasonal winds and the Earth‚Äôs movements.
-The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved by a group of divers in 1900 and has been dubbed ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first analog computer‚Äù and it was made around 200 B.C.E.

Ours is said to be a Godless age, yet billions remain faithful to religions thousands of years old.

Scientist Colin Blakemore examines Christianity's relationship with science, arguing that science is the biggest challenge Christianity has ever faced.

For more than 1,500 years Christians saw the bible as the primary source of knowledge, but in the 17th century a new movement emerged that challenged the Christian view of the world, the Scientific Revolution.  During the Renaissance the rising power of science forced the Catholic Church to silence rebellious scientists.  By the 19th century the enlightenment had given rise to a new generation of scientists who pushed Christianity into retreat.

If science continues to make discoveries that conflict with Christian Doctrine will the Scientific Revolution ultimately make Christianity redundant?

""Christianity: A History"" is a documentary series presenting alternative views on the history of the Christian faith, looking at its origins, development and turbulent past.  High profile British personalities examine a religion that has particular resonance for them.  In doing so, they bring their own perspectives to a challenging and comprehensive debate that explores Christianity's role in shaping the modern world.",Science and Technology
162,n7YQOzNuS,Science vs God: Bryan Enderle at TEDxUCDavis,"Bryan Enderle grew up in Modesto, CA though he now lives in Davis, CA with his wife, Peggy, and son, Isaac. Bryan received two BS degrees, in Chemical and Petroleum Engineering; an MA in Theology; and an MS and PhD in Chemical Engineering. Personally, he enjoys grappling with the topics of theology and science, both as individual and intersecting topics. Without arguing one way or the other, Enderle uses modern science to make certain fantastic aspects of a modern God more plausible. In doing so he creates a space where science and religion can coexist.

174,Tzl0ELY_TiM,What is Computer Science?,"Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Vqx...

In this part 1 video of ""What is Computer Science?"" I cover programming and discrete math in some detail.

Computer science is often thought of as just glorified programming. But once you enter undergrad you will realize this is not the entire story. Computer science has more to it including discrete math, algorithms, theory of computation, hardware programming, and more. If you just want to learn how to program, then the computer science major will be more than you are expecting.

In this video I mostly cover discrete math and concepts within it because of how important it is for classes to come. Although it's not used in all your classes, I show you examples so you have an idea of what math you will encounter.

180,HQx5Be9g16U,10 Amazing Science Tricks Using Liquid!,"Add me on Facebook (click LIKE on Facebook to add me) - http://www.facebook.com/brusspup

Detailed information for the tricks in the video:

1. Slow motion ball:

You need a thick liquid, preferably honey, a heavy ball, and a sphere shaped container. Place the heavy ball in the lower half of the sphere. Fill the lower half of the container with honey a little more than half.
If you use too little or too much, it will affect the motion of the ball.

2. Water fire starter. Credit goes to The King of Random for this idea. Be sure to check out his channel. He has a huge selection of amazing how to experiments. 

You need a plastic or glass container with a curved area. The Pom bottles work great. Fill the bottle with water. Fold 2 sheets of paper in half, twice. Print or scribble a black mark on one of the sheets. On a sunny day hold the bottle near the paper, focusing the light on the black area of the paper. Once it starts to smoke and a hole begins to form, wrap the other sheet of paper around the smoking piece. Wave the papers through the air to feed oxygen to the spark. Continue this until the paper catches on fire.

3.  No-leak magic bag:
     Al you need is a zip baggy, pencils and water. Fill the bag almost to the top. Zip it shut, and start sticking pencils through the bag. Sometimes a few drops will leak out, but overall, this is a simple yet impressive trick

4. Liquid Stacking:
You'll need a tall glass or bottle. Dish Soap, vegetable oil, dark corn syrup, rubbing alcohol, water and food coloring.

First add the dark corn syrup, then dish soap, then add food coloring to the water and pour it in with the bottle tilted, then add the vegetable oil (bottle tilted), and finally add food coloring to the alcohol and pour it in with the bottle tilted.

5. Invisible Bottle:

You need glycerin, a glass and a bottle that will fit in the glass. Fill both glass and bottle with glycerin and place the bottle in the glass. It looks like the bottle disappears.

6. Dancing Liquid:

You need  a powered speaker, a tone generator (can be found online), corn starch, water and plastic to protect the speaker. Pour 1/2 cup of corn starch in a bowl and 1/4 cup of water. Mix. Pour the liquid into the speaker and generate a 60hz tone.

7. Magic Water Barrier:

You need 2 of the same glasses. Hot water, cold water, food coloring and a thin piece of plastic or cardboard. Pour the hot water in 1 glass, the cold in the other glass, add food coloring, then place the plastic on top of the hot water glass. Turn the glass upside down, place it on top of the cold water glass, then carefully remove the plastic. Hot water is less dense than cold water, so it ""floats"" on top of the cold water.

8. Leidenfrost effect:

You need a pan, water and a stove. Turn the heat on high for about 4 minutes then add the water. This experiment can stain your pans.

9. Reverse Illusion:

Add all sorts of images or words behind a glass, then watch as it reverses when you add water in the glass.

10. Reversing Liquid:

You need 1 big glass, 1 smaller glass, 3 mixing glasses, corn syrup, pipettes, food coloring, and clips.

First pour the corn syrup into the 2 bigger glasses. Place the smaller glass inside of the bigger glass. Attach the clips to prevent the smaller glass from moving side to side in the bigger glass. Pour a small amount of corn syrup into the 3 mixing glasses. Add food coloring and stir. Fill each pipette with a different color, then add the colored corn syrup to your big glass. Turn the smaller glass carefully and watch the colors mix. Turn it back and watch them unmix.

192,NVuQh1-JQ,Scientists Created a Plastic That‚Äôs Infinitely Recyclable,"Plastic is suffocating the planet, but what if we could make recycling plastic more efficient? This Lawrence Berkeley National Lab team has created a brand new kind of plastic that can be recycled endlessly. 

Are You Seasoning Your Food With Microplastics?  - 

Read More: 
Closed-loop recycling of plastics enabled by dynamic covalent diketoenamine bonds
 
""The closed-loop polymer life cycles enabled by PDKs contrast with those for conventional polymers, which are synthesized using irreversible bond-forming reactions that make it difficult and costly to recover the original monomers in high purity. Furthermore, while dynamic covalent polymers have been designed, in principle, around the ability to exchange bonds27, examples of energy-efficient depolymerization and chemical separations to obtain immediately reusable monomers are exceedingly rare. ""

Plastic Gets a Do-Over: Breakthrough Discovery Recycles Plastic From the Inside Out
 
According to the researchers, the problem with many plastics is that the chemicals added to make them useful ‚Äì such as fillers that make a plastic tough, or plasticizers that make a plastic flexible ‚Äì are tightly bound to the monomers and stay in the plastic even after it‚Äôs been processed at a recycling plant.

Facts and Figures about Materials, Waste and Recycling
 
""PA used data from the American Chemistry Council and the National Association for PET Container Resources to measure the recycling of plastic. While overall the amount of recycled plastics is relatively small‚Äî3.1 million tons for a 9.1 percent recycling rate in 2015‚Äîthe recycling of some specific types of plastic containers is more significant. The recycling rate of PET bottles and jars was 29.9 percent in 2015, and the rate for HDPE natural bottles was 30.3 percent in 2015.""

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

A disaster is looming.  A fabulous city, rich in culture, and technological advances, is about to be destroyed.  Buildings, people, an entire civilisation, swept away by an overwhelming natural disaster.  The legend has entranced scientists and scholars for centuries.

In this episode Naked Science goes in search of the most enduring myth of all - The City of Atlantis - lost beneath the waves to a massive natural cataclysm some 11,000 years ago.  We know very little of Atlantis, in fact were it not for the writings of the Greek philosopher Plato we might not have encountered it at all.  Plato, recounting a story he heard as a child, described a huge metropolis, rich in fine art, architecture and culture.  The city was destroyed in the space of a day and a night, sunk beneath the waves for eternity by a massive natural cataclysm.  For thousands of years the tale remained an obscure yet tantalising fable until an American by the name of Ignatius Donnelly reignited the idea, bringing it to worldwide attention and sending archaeologists and trophy hunters alike across the globe in its wake.",Science and Technology

Science
What is it all about
Techmology 
What is that all about
Is it good or is it whack
What is it all about

There's a bloke from round my hood
Who reject everyfin to do with science
He just chill at home, smoke his own home grown
And check this - he don't have a tele

He lives in a house though
And that house is a product of technology
No he aint got no technology in it
You can check out his website

Has computers made our lives better
Will computers ever be able to work out what
999999999
multiplied by
9999999
The answer's yes
You don't know what I was gonna say
10 10 10 10 10 10 10

Between you and the rest of the world lies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ in your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to 1.7 square metres of ground. But besides keeping your organs in, what is its purpose?

207,HsQR1lkBzeg,7 Mysterious Discoveries Scientists Can't Explain,"There are amazing discoveries that made the smartest scientists scratch their heads for years. These experts spend their whole lives searching for answers to some of the world‚Äôs biggest mysteries. Yet some of their findings defy logic and are still waiting to be solved.

TIMESTAMPS:
The Maine Penny 
Gold Spirals 
Alaska Artifact 
Rujm el-Hiri 
Mohenjo-Daro 
Longyou Caves 
Swimming Reindeer 

 

Music by Epidemic Sound   

SUMMARY: 
- The coin was made between 1605 and 1093 during the reign of King Olaf III. But how did a silver Norse coin, the only Norse artifact discovered at the site, travel all the way to Maine?
- Flemming and other researchers assumed that these gold spirals were part of a priest-king‚Äôs costume or headwear, which would have been worn during ritual sun ceremonies.
- The buckle-like object had been cast in a mold with a small leather ring attached to the bar, and it was about 2‚Äù by 1‚Äù. Thanks to its leather material, the researchers were able to estimate how old the object is through radiocarbon analysis: it‚Äôs 1,500 years old.
- Rujim el-Hiri is another remnant of the Bronze Age, and it dates back to an estimated 3000 to 2700 BCE. The megalithic structure is located in Golan Heights and is made from approximately 44,000 tons of basalt stones. 
- Mohenjo-Daro can rival the greatness of ancient Rome, though it didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúcentral seat of government or evidence of a king or queen‚Äù according to a National Geographic article. 
- The Longyou Caves in Zhejiang province, China, aren‚Äôt your ordinary caves with cavernous passages, stalagmites, and stalactites. The 2,000-year-old man-made caves consist of 36 grottoes covering approximately 32,000 sq ft.
- The Swimming Reindeer is made from the tip of a mammoth tusk that is 8‚Äù long. The sculptor possessed extraordinary creativity and skill: it was beautifully crafted with great detail using only stone tools.

Albert Einstein is the most popular physicist, as he formulated the theory of relativity, which gave the Energy mass equivalence formula and is directly related to time dilation. But what is time dilation? Time dilation and space time are interrelated. Einstein made one of the most important contributions to physics and had the concept of space time explained. A simple explanation of space time is that it is a mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. But it is very important to understand that the general theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity are different. In this short animated video, we give a simple explanation of time dilation and Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity and also explain how time slows down in a moving vehicle!

Now that the giddiness has subsided and I personally have stopped spending hours on end staring at a black spot, we can take a breath and actually look at the real science here and discuss exactly how a picture like this could be taken and what we can learn from it.

Need a Black Hole Refresher


  

Hosted by Matt O'Dowd
Written by Matt O'Dowd
Graphics by Murilo Ceasar Lopes
Directed by Andrew Kornhaber
Produced By: Kornhaber Brown

So, how do you take a picture of a black hole? The beast in question is the supermassive black hole in the center of this ‚Äì the M87 elliptical galaxy. It has an estimated mass of several billion times that of the Sun, which gives it an event horizon larger than the solar system. M87 is 53 million light years away, so resolving that black hole is equivalent to resolving a grain of stand on the beach in LA ‚Äì if you‚Äôre standing in New York. By comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope would struggle to see a large watermelon over that distance.

So maybe we can't outrun cheetahs or antelope, but humans are uniquely adapted for long distance running. What does science have to say about marathon running? To find out, (and because I was feeling a little crazy) I decided to run one!

Here's what I discovered about the science of long distance running

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Greek Fire
he Greek fire used by the Byzantine Empire in the 7th century is one of the biggest secrets in science. 

+ Damascus Steel
Sword was constructed with Damascus steel. The strength, flexibility and wave-like patterns made them completely unique.  It is a fact that they could cut a silk veil in the air, and they could slice a rock without damaging the blade's sharpness.

+ The Voynich Manuscript 
Wilfrid Voynich, a Lithuanian antiquarian of Polish origin got a manuscript by an anonymous author. The content of this manuscript is still unknown.  botany, biology, and astrology.

+ The Antikythera Mechanism
It is is actually a 2000 years old analog computer. The Antikythera mechanism was recovered from the bottom of the sea in 1901, near Antikythera island, Greece.

+ Zhang Hang Seismograph
Zhang-Hang, a Chinese scientist, and an astronomer from the East Han Dynasty presented this seismoscope in the year 132AD.  It is a copper vessel with dragon heads aiming at the cardinal points.

+ Ulfberht Sword
Many tombs from the Viking age have been discovered all over the north of Europe. Archaeologists have found inside the tombs a total of 171 Ulfberht swords. These swords were made with techniques that were very advanced for that age. They got their name from the inscription +ULFBERHT+ on their blades.

+ The Iron Pillar of Delhi
This iron pillar, weighing six tonnes and 7.21 meters high, which has not rusted during more than 1600 years, it is still an engineering mystery, located in Delhi, India.

+ The Phaistos Disc
  Luigi Pernier, an Italian archaeologist, discovered the Phaistos disc on the Greek island of Crete in 1908. This disc, also known as the Rosetta stone of the Minoan civilization, and made from baked clay.

+ Roman Dodecahedron
One of those mysteries is the Roman dodecahedron. It dates back to 200 years AD. It is a hollow object with 12 sides, made-up of brass or stone.

+ Giant Stone Spheres 
More than 500 pre-Columbian stone spheres were discovered in the Sierpe district, in the south of Costa Rica in 1939. The size of the stones ranges from 30 to 257, and they weigh between two kilos and 16 tonnes.

Darwin's theory of biological evolution helps us understand how simple life forms can give rise to complex lifeforms, but how did the first reproducing creatures come about? The origin of life needs its own explanation.

Scientists don't currently have a complete explanation for life's origins, but different labs around the globe are looking into the idea that life may have emerged from chemistry. In this animation you will learn why they are studying this idea, and you'll get to see a few of the fascinating things they have discovered.

Here are some links for further learning (organized by topic):

OVERVIEW OF CURRENT RESEARCH

Here David Deamer gives a wonderful overview of our current understanding of the origin of life. This hour long lecture is presented in clear language for all to follow:



SELF-ASSEMBLY

News article on the self assembly of gene-like columns: 

Video series on the self assembly of primitive cell membranes: 


Video interview with chemist Jack Szostak. In it he goes over his work on self-assembling membranes and genes.


Scientific journal exploring molecules with self-assembly properties. (You need a subscription to the journal to get past the abstract)



RNA SYNTHESIS

Video on John Sutherland's production of RNA nucleotides  



EARLY FOSSILS

David Attenborough explores the lives of early organisms found in the fossil record. This video explores the evolution of early organisms but does not go over the origin of the first living things.  



METABOLIC PATHWAYS

This research explores a primitive metabolic pathway which could have easily formed through chemical evolution on the ancient earth (you need a subscription to the journal to get past the abstract)

237,O0Uzy35uJzU,The Science of Sleep: Melatonin to Neural Pathways,"Russell Foster, Debra Skene and Stafford Lightman discuss the science of sleep. Why do we need sleep and what are the physiological processes driving our circadian rhythm? When is our circadian clock disrupted and how does this affect our health? Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs the debate.
Subscribe for regular science videos: 

The science behind sleeplessness can help us understand our rhythms so we can live better and healthier lives. While hormones, such a melatonin, play a role in driving our circadian clock, the amount of sleep we get and our sleep cycles also affect our hormonal release patterns, with far-reaching implications on our health.

Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs a discussion with a panel of experts who specialise in circadian rhythms. They explore how light detection plays a role in our sleep-wake cycles, how hormone release is regulated and the implications of changes to our circadian clock and sleeplessness over time.

This event was supported by British Psychological Society and Society for Endocrinology.

Russell Foster is Professor of Circadian Neuroscience at the University of Oxford. The research interests of his group range across visual neuroscience, circadian rhythms and sleep.
You can buy his book ""The Rhythms Of Life"" now - 

Debra Skene is Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey. She leads the research group 'Sleep, Chronobiology and Addiction' and her research focusses on links between human circadian clocks, sleep and metabolism in health, circadian disorders and metabolic diseases.

Stafford Lightman is Professor of Medicine at Bristol University. Researching the mechanisms of stress-related disease, his research has particularly looked at how neuroendocrine rhythms signal to other tissues in the body.

To understand how crystals work, it‚Äôs important to embody the understanding that everything is fundamentally one energy, everything vibrates together in a great unified quantum field. 

This comes up within almost every episode because it relates to literally everything in existence. 

Seeing that everything can be seen as an extension of ourselves, crystals are exactly that. They are conductors, transmuters and channelers of energy. 

Each one has their own geometric lattice, and thus, their own particular radiant energy.

Lyrics
--
Making science! Making science!
Is so fine!
She's awake now...
...and won't the subjects be surprised!
She's awake again!
Making science! Making science!
MAKING SCIENCE!?
I'll build a turret with a gun...
...we'll shoot at you and make you run!
Oh my god! What have I done!?
It's time for testing!
Making science! Making science!
Cubes and lasers,placed in chambers...
...ready for subjects to solve the tests.
She's awake again!
Sleep mode: OFF
Now here we go...
...with all my tests we're...
...making science now!
I can't believe what's happening to me...
...I'm in control...
...of the facility!
Heheh... hurhur... uhh... that's tiring.
Won't they be impressed: I'm not a moron!
See how I change this peaceful test...
...into something that'll kill this pest!
Hmm... my compliments, from me to you!
Heh... I can't believe you actually made it through!
Now would you just stay there please!?
I'd like to introduce you to...
...huh? Nononono! DO COME BACK!
Fine, no. Don't meet him then...
...it's 'Mr. Mashy' - the spike plate.
He'd like to reduce your weight!
Ha... ha... little joke... there...
Sleep Mode: OFF
Now here we go...
...with all our guns...
...we're making science now!
Making science! Making science!
La! La! La!
It's finally here...
...and we can't wait!
So lock and load and take your aim!
'cos when the subjects start to die...
...we'll all sing out...
...""IT'S SCIENCE!""

Description:
The notion of beauty and what makes someone beautiful has been debated for centuries. The Han Dynasty in 206 B.C. thought that large eyes were the most beautiful. Ancient Egyptians thought that women with narrow shoulders and high waists were the most aesthetically pleasing. It wasn‚Äôt until the ancient Greeks came up with a formula to calculate the perfect ratio for beauty, that we could have quantitative proof of someone‚Äôs beauty.

Applications open June 1:  This video was sponsored by Regeneron. The Science Talent Search was founded and produced by the Society for Science and the Public.

Huge thanks to the students: Ronak Roy, Ana Humphrey, and Anjali Chadha. It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.

Special thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.

Ronak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.

Ana used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.

Anjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) talks Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) into using his computer to simulate a woman.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
John Hughes's third directorial effort, Weird Science, follows in the tradition of his previous teen-centered films, Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play the wannabe hipster Gary and his nebbish weak-willed best friend, Wyatt, a pair of high-school geeks who are hapless with members of the opposite sex. Using Wyatt's computer, they create what they believe is the ideal woman. A lightning storm brings that woman to life, and she takes the form of Kelly Le Brock. Lisa sets about building their self-confidence, but trouble begins brewing when Wyatt's cruel, military-minded older brother, Chet (Bill Paxton), begins to realize that something is not as it should be. Hughes would finish his cycle of high-school themed films with his next movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

283,VtCO84MDj8,Khan Academy and the Effectiveness of Science Videos,"My PhD: http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/super/...
It is a common view that ""if only someone could break this down and explain it clearly enough, more students would understand."" Khan Academy is a great example of this approach with its clear, concise videos on science. However it is debatable whether they really work. Research has shown that these types of videos may be positively received by students. They feel like they are learning and become more confident in their answers, but tests reveal they haven't learned anything. The apparent reason for the discrepancy is misconceptions. Students have existing ideas about scientific phenomena before viewing a video. If the video presents scientific concepts in a clear, well illustrated way, students believe they are learning but they do not engage with the media on a deep enough level to realize that what was is presented differs from their prior knowledge. There is hope, however. Presenting students' common misconceptions in a video alongside the scientific concepts has been shown to increase learning by increasing the amount of mental effort students expend while watching it.",Science and Technology

They dared question the Scientistic Orthodoxy, and for that they have been publicly castigated and defamed.

BIO:
Rupert Sheldrake, Ph.D. (born 28 June 1942) is a biologist and author of more than 80 scientific papers and ten books. A former Research Fellow of the Royal Society, he studied natural sciences at Cambridge University, where he was a Scholar of Clare College, took a double first class honours degree and was awarded the University Botany Prize. He then studied philosophy and history of science at Harvard University, where he was a Frank Knox Fellow, before returning to Cambridge, where he took a Ph.D. in biochemistry. He was a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, where he was Director of Studies in biochemistry and cell biology. As the Rosenheim Research Fellow of the Royal Society, he carried out research on the development of plants and the ageing of cells in the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge University.

While at Cambridge, together with Philip Rubery, he discovered the mechanism of polar auxin transport, the process by which the plant hormone auxin is carried from the shoots towards the roots.

From 1968 to 1969, based in the Botany Department of the University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, he studied rain forest plants. From 1974 to 1985 he was Principal Plant Physiologist and Consultant Physiologist at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Hyderabad, India, where he helped develop new cropping systems now widely used by farmers. While in India, he also lived for a year and a half at the ashram of Fr Bede Griffiths in Tamil Nadu, where he wrote his first book, A New Science of Life.

From 2005-2010 he was the Director of the Perrott-Warrick Project funded from Trinity College,Cambridge. He is a Fellow of Schumacher College , in Dartington, Devon, a Fellow of the Institute of Noetic Sciences near San Francisco, and a Visiting Professor at the Graduate Institute in Connecticut.

He lives in London with his wife Jill Purce and two sons.

He has appeared in many TV programs in Britain and overseas, and was one of the participants (along with Stephen Jay Gould, Daniel Dennett, Oliver Sacks, Freeman Dyson and Stephen Toulmin) in a TV series called A Glorious Accident, shown on PBS channels throughout the US. He has often taken part in BBC and other radio programmes. He has written for newspapers such as the Guardian, where he had a regular monthly column, The Times, Sunday Telegraph, Daily Mirror, Daily Mail, Sunday Times, Times Educational Supplement, Times Higher Education Supplement and Times Literary Supplement, and has contributed to a variety of magazines, including New Scientist, Resurgence, the Ecologist and the Spectator.

‚ñ≤Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/WILearned
‚ñ≤Twitter:  

This video will explain why hunger won't get worse and worse while fasting and why keeping your blood glucose and insulin low & why trying a keto diet will help you adapt to fasting a lot easier. 

When I first started doing intermittent fasting, handling the hunger was quite difficult. I tried several things to try and make myself less hungry without breaking the fast, but what was most helpful was knowing that it would go away on its own, and why this was the case. So, I hope that this video helps those of you trying out prolonged or intermittent fasting - hunger is pretty much inescapable, there is going to be some level of discomfort when trying out fasting, but it's very encouraging to know that things will change and hunger will naturally go away. 

Sections:
 - Why hunger is rhythmic & doesn't just get stronger over time
 - Why low Salt may be cause of your hunger while fasting
 - How Insulin works
 - How Glucagon works
 - Insulin Makes you Hungry, Glucagon doesn't
 - Ketones/Ketosis & Hunger
 - Why you shouldn't go overboard on protein
 - Letpin, the satiety hormone

The devil's kettle waterfall is believed by some to be a gateway to another universe or even to hell itself. The two streamed waterfall has baffled geologists for decades as no one can work out where the water flowing into the kettle leads. It's as if it simply disappears. But that's not the only mysterious water structure. In the amazon river is now known to be a boiling river hot enough to kill any creature to fall into it. It was thought nothing more than a myth until it's recent discovery and no one knows why the water is hot enough to boil.

In India stands a small village known for having a high twin rate. It's obvious why the settlement is now known as twin town but less obvious why so many twins are born here. Suggested answers include the claim that government experiments secretly changed the genetics of locals decades ago.

Perhaps the most mysterious location is the zone of silence in Mexico, a place known for magnetic phenomena and as a dead zone for radio. You will receive no radio signal while in the zone and don't expect your compass to be reliable.

Genetic engineering used to be thought of as a fantasy. The ability to change what an animal is at its core was thought to be immoral and likely not even possible. But through science, it seems that every experiment in modified genetics is just a matter of time until success. When a scientist sits down in their lab, they are able to create some scary stuff! Animals that are usually average all of a sudden become a lesson in biology right in front of your face. For example, a mouse was created with a human appendage on its back and it shocked the world. But not as much as another animal on our list named Dolly. The cartilage was only made to look human however, because it had been injected with parts of a cow as well! Frogs that you would usually dissect in school in the classroom are now beyond that. Scientists have modified them through experiments to become beyond cutting. A sheep became the first mammal of its kind to be cloned! And cloning is no easy task‚Ä¶ Ask any mad scientist from television and movies. The science behind these amazing experiments is incredibly advanced. It‚Äôs almost as if a scientist would need to be mad to complete them! When they get into the lab, anything is possible. 
Once you see these strange animals, you will realize that the future is now. Anytime we thought modifying genetics wasn‚Äôt possible, we have been proven wrong by scientists. So let‚Äôs take a look at the Strange Animals Created by Scientists.

Do Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Jules Verne, Philip K. Dick, Hugo Gernsback, Robert Heinlein, or Isaac Asimov hold a candle to H.G. Wells when it comes to correctly predicting the future of science via science fiction?

And why does some science fiction do such a good job of predicting the future in the first place?

For more than 60 years, the UCSF Willed Body Program has overseen the donation of bodies for medical education and research. Andrew Corson, director of the UCSF Willed Body Program, talks about the program, which is the largest such program in the state, receiving approximately 400 donated bodies a year. Cadavers donated to UCSF are supplied to a number of programs including UCSF's School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and School of Pharmacy, as well as the orthopedics, ophthalmology, otolaryngology and physical therapy departments. Additionally, UCSF provides cadavers to other UC campuses and approximately 50 non-UC schools in Northern California, research groups and emergency medical education programs. Each entity must adhere to strict protocol guidelines, and each application is vetted by the UCSF Anatomical Material Review Committee.",Science and Technology

About Atomic School:
Atomic School supports the teaching of Atomic Theory to primary school & science students .
We provide lesson plans, hands-on classroom resources, demonstration equipment, quizzes and a Teacher's Manual to primary school teachers. Animated videos that clearly explain the scientific ideas supports learning by both teachers and students. As a teacher, you don't have to look anywhere else to implement this program.

Our work has been verified by science education researchers at the University of Southern Queensland, Dr Jenny Donovan and Dr Carole Haeusler, who confirm that primary students are capable of learning much more complex scientific concepts than previously thought, and crucially, that they love it. Students run to class!

The program has been trialed in Australian schools as well as schools in the Philippines, Iran and India. It is conducted as holiday workshops at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Queensland Museum as well as the World Science Festival.
It has attracted wide media interest, including TV, radio and print, and the research data has been presented at prestigious American Education Research Association and Australian Science Education Research Association conferences. 

Atomic Theory underlies all the other sciences- genetics, electronics, nanotechnology, engineering and astronomy- so an early understanding will set them up for a more successful learning sequence for all their science subjects, and support their mastery of mathematics as well. We also have extension programs that cover Biology, Physics and Astronomy to an equal depth.



About Ian Stuart (Email: ian.douglas.stuart@gmail.com):
The founder of Atomic School, Ian Stuart, taught Chemistry and Physics for 25 years at senior levels before he realized that his 8-year old son, Tom, could understand Atomic Theory at a much deeper level than he expected. After visiting Tom's class at school, he discovered that his peers could also grasp the abstract scientific concepts, as well as apply it usefully to the real world.

Ian then developed a program to teach the advanced concepts of high school Chemistry, Physics and Biology to students 10 years younger than they normally would. He found that this engaged their interest in modern science early, and sustained it through to high school and beyond. It also sets them up for future success in their academic and career paths.

Ian has a Bachelor's Degree in Chemistry from the University of Queensland and a Master's degree in Electrochemistry from the University of Melbourne.

You‚Äôve seen VTEC on cars, but what does VTEC mean?  VTEC has to do with the valves in your engine that help dictate airflow, horsepower and fuel consumption.  This Science Garage gets into Cams, lobes, lifters and more before narrowing in on how VTEC works.  Cars have single cams, overhead cams, dual overhead cams and even triple overhead cams to help them do their jobs.  VTEC is a unique variable cam design that has changed the way we think of engines‚Ä¶ get ready, because VTEC just kicked in!
 
Bart teaches us how cars work by blowing stuff up and cutting things in half.  It‚Äôs a science show for the car lover who‚Äôs easily bored.  Join Bart as he explains the science behind everything automotive.  This is cars down to the atom.  This is Science Garage.

Description: http://events.ccc.de/congress/2011/Fa...

Meredith L. Patterson, Sergey: The Science of Insecurity

Why is the overwhelming majority of common networked software still not secure, despite all effort to the contrary? Why is it almost certain to get exploited so long as attackers can craft its inputs? Why is it the case that no amount of effort seems to be enough to fix software that must speak certain protocols?

The answer to these questions is that for many protocols and services currently in use on the Internet, the problem of recognizing and validating their ""good"", expected inputs from bad ones is either not well-posed or is undecidable (i. e., no algorithm can exist to solve it in the general case), which means that their implementations cannot even be comprehensively tested, let alone automatically checked for weaknesses or correctness. The designers' desire for more functionality has made these protocols effectively unsecurable.

In this talk we'll draw a direct connection between this ubiquitous insecurity and basic computer science concepts of Turing completeness and theory of languages. We will show how well-meant protocol designs are doomed to their implementations becoming clusters of 0-days, and will show where to look for these 0-days. We will also discuss simple principles of how to avoid designing such protocols.",Science and Technology

312,d8s8e8JdGC,The Science of Dubstep | James Humberstone | TEDxOxford,"The theme for TEDxOxford in 2016 was ‚Äúfind X‚Äù. In his talk ‚Äúthe Science of Dubstep‚Äù, James Humberstone proposes that if this and future generations are going to ‚Äúfind X‚Äù, every nation needs to revolutionise education and develop cohorts of workers who can think abstractly. A composer, technologist, musicologist and music educator, Humberstone claims that music is the most abstract of all the arts and that technologically rich, culturally appropriate musical training could lead that educational revolution, turning the focus away from high stakes standardised testing and toward engaging and inspiring student-centred learning. Along the way he explains how incredible human perception of sound is, and composes a 12-tone dubstep song with the help of the TED audience!

As a composer, technologist and teacher, James Humberstone believes that music education can lead all education through the challenges of the 21st Century. After all, there is no more experiential, creative, child-centred subject than music ‚Äì or so he claims. A trained ‚Äòclassical‚Äô composer, James migrated to Sydney, Australia in 1997 and has also worked in the fields of music software, education (with children and adults of all ages), and as a musicologist. Today he is a lecturer in music education at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, and remains an active composer. His recent musical output included a permanent electro-acoustic installation at the Australian National Maritime Museum on board a retired destroyer and a submarine. In 2016 James is collaborating on a Hip Hop album, and composing a song cycle. He has also just released the University of Sydney‚Äôs first (free) MOOC, ‚ÄúThe Place of Music in 21st Century Education‚Äù at www.coursera.org.

Lyrics:

[Sagan]
If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch
You must first invent the universe

Space is filled with a network of wormholes
You might emerge somewhere else in space
Some when-else in time

The sky calls to us
If we do not destroy ourselves
We will one day venture to the stars

A still more glorious dawn awaits
Not a sunrise, but a galaxy rise
A morning filled with 400 billion suns
The rising of the milky way

The Cosmos is full beyond measure of elegant truths
Of exquisite interrelationships 
Of the awesome machinery of nature

I believe our future depends powerfully 
On how well we understand this cosmos
In which we float like a mote of dust
In the morning sky

But the brain does much more than just recollect
It inter-compares, it synthesizes, it analyzes 
it generates abstractions

The simplest thought like the concept of the number one 
Has an elaborate logical underpinning
The brain has its own language
For testing the structure and consistency of the world

[Hawking]
For thousands of years
People have wondered about the universe
Did it stretch out forever
Or was there a limit

From the big bang to black holes
From dark matter to a possible big crunch
Our image of the universe today
Is full of strange sounding ideas

[Sagan}
How lucky we are to live in this time
The first moment in human history 
When we are in fact visiting other worlds

The surface of the earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean
Recently we've waded a little way out
And the water seems inviting",Science and Technology
315,jxsnYsA549Y,Why Japanese Are So Thin According to Science,"Why are Japanese people so thin? What do people eat in Japan? While the rest of the world is seeing anywhere from 15 to over 30% of its population severely overweight, Japan has managed to keep that number at just 3.6%. When it comes to health tips, it's better to turn to the country with the longest life expectancy and one of the lowest obesity rates on the planet. If you‚Äôre ready to find out how the Japanese manage to stay so effortlessly thin, keep our new video!

In Japan, they usually stick to 3 wholesome meals a day that don‚Äôt leave them hungry or dealing with sudden cravings. Those who do snack keep it in small quantities and with a lot of moderation.
Also, the secret to Japan‚Äôs success begins with their diet, which is pretty carb-heavy and low in saturated fats. Their main dishes of choice include vegetables, grains, fish, and meat. Dairy products and fruits are consumed in moderation. They tend to stay away from foods with excessive amounts of salt and sugar, like burgers and soda.

SUMMARY: 
- The secret to Japan‚Äôs success begins with their diet, which is pretty carb-heavy and low in saturated fats. Their main dishes of choice include vegetables, grains, fish, and meat.
- Just like the rest of the world, a lot of Japanese people have a hectic schedule that doesn‚Äôt leave a lot of time or opportunity to prepare a home-cooked meal. In that case, they can turn to their version of fast food, which is usually a lot healthier and resembles home-style cooking.
- Most Japanese people have very regulated meal times. They eat 3 filling meals a day, with breakfast usually happening between 8 and 9am, lunch from 12 to 1pm, and dinner between 6 and 8pm.
- It‚Äôs a lot more common for Japanese children to walk or cycle to school. Of course, other countries have a lot of reasons why it might not be efficient or safe for kids to hoof it to class.
- Portion sizes have been on a steep rise in the last 20 years throughout the world. For example, countries like Australia, Canada, Germany, the U.S., and the U.K. have much larger fast food portions than Japan.
- Separate bicycle lanes and plenty of safe areas for pedestrians are common sites in Japan. This allows the Japanese to naturally burn calories as they commute to and from work or school every day.
- Tea, especially the green variety, is the number one beverage in Japan. Green tea has been praised for having a ton of major health benefits, like increasing metabolism, burning fat, fighting anxiety, and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, to name a few.
- The practice of using chopsticks also helps in weight management, since they make you eat more slowly and in smaller bites. This slow process of eating helps people catch when they‚Äôre feeling full and avoid eating too much. The fact that food is served on a bunch of plates also slows down the process.
- The number one way that the Japanese stay thin has to do with removing distractions and being mindful about the process of food consumption. Eating in Japan is treated with respect.

330,5jmN_tBS0t4,Computer science education: why does it suck so much and what if it didn‚Äôt? | Ashley Gavin | TEDxNYU,"Ashley‚Äôs talk shines a light on the major problem that is American Computer Science education. In 2020, 1.4 million new jobs will be available for those with competing backgrounds, but we‚Äôll only have engineers to fill two-thirds of them. Ashley shows us how we can right this wrong.

Ashley Gavin is a computer science education consultant with a passion for making computer science curricula empowering, accessible, and above all, fun. Her work in curriculum and program development serves as the foundation for some of the finest educational organizations in the country including her brainchild ‚ÄúGirls Who Code‚Äù.

During high school, Ashley was actively interested in tech. However, she was denied access to computer science courses at her school due her failing grades in math and science. In her senior year, the newly appointed CS teacher noticed her affinity for tech and took a risk by letting her drop math and take computer science instead. Ashley has since been working to do so for as many students as possible, especially those in underrepresented groups.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",Science and Technology

I also figured out how much the carnival actually pays for the prizes so even if you win, you lose.  And then I visited the carnival with my professional baseball playing buddy to dominate all the games.  It worked well.

Welcome to Science WARS!
Chemistry-Bio-Physics-Mathematical
But which field is best?

PHYSICS:

I understand the force and energy
Quantum mechanics and relativity
My field is pure and they rely on me
I see the universe like nobody

You may have made fun of me in high school
For being awkward and following the rules
Now I‚Äôve got laser (WOW, That‚Äôs really cool) 
May the mass times acceleration be you 

Atoms-Entropy-Dark Matter-String Theory

CHEMISTRY:

If you want to feel a bond
Then I can give you a good reaction
The elements that make up life 
Are my essence, are my satisfaction 

All the other fields out there are so basic
Yeah, I‚Äôm the central science
Keep your eye on me
I‚Äôll get you charged

If you need me, call me up on
Avogadro's Number
If you leave me, take a titrant 
Shove it up your acid buffer

Dopamine and serotonin
Will keep you good and happy 
So get your flask and your glass all set up
And begin to understand the world!

BIO:

Within me you‚Äôll find life‚Äôs beauty
In genetics and ecology
Symbiosis and not division
Unless it‚Äôs mitosis or the study of fission

Even if you don‚Äôt pass, at least you‚Äôll enjoy my class!

Evolution, has brung us along
All species singing one song

MATH:

If you want to learn about the world I must say
I am the purest field of study you can take
Immune to misinterpretation
The blueprint of creation 
The backbone of all things science

No bias, just constant augmentation
In your mind, and observation
No gadgets, just your logic and your time

And PIE

ENDING:

Together we will find the answers to life!
With physics-bio-chemistry-and math
We can...SCIENCE!",Science and Technology
342,i8Zo1_FN6x,Naked Science - Colliding Continents,"Subscribe to Naked Science - http://goo.gl/wpc2Q1

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

How were the continents formed?

We walk over them without a second thought, but where did the land beneath our feet come from?  We go back in time to the oldest rocks on earth, to see how the first continents formed on our fledgling planet.  We see how continents are just lighter rocks, floating on a layer of denser molten rock, the mantle.

Travelling to the bottom of the Grand Canyon we follow the process of erosion and sedimentation that created the landscape we see today.  At the Giant‚Äôs Causeway, in Ireland, we tell the story of how a continent split into two, creating America and Europe, and in the Himalayas, we see how two continents colliding create the tallest mountains on earth.

But what of the future?  Using computer simulations, we trace the progress of the continents over the next 250 million years and discover that they will all merge into one.",Science and Technology
343,ReVeUvwTGdU,3 years of Computer Science in 8 minutes,"This is the most asked question on my channel by far so I thought I'd explain how I learned programming. In the process I got a little distracted and accidentally explained all of computer science in 8 minutes (kind of). 

The goal of this video was to show you the connections between modern day (high-level) programming and how it was implemented at the low level. I show you the basics in Java and convert it to C code, then into Assembly, which leads me to talk about how computers perform addition/subtraction, and the logic design behind that is all implemented with transistors. In case you couldn't tell, I love low level programming. Just a disclaimer that I'm not saying this is the best way to learn programming I am simply sharing what I feel was the most valuable in my learning so far. I know many people start with web technologies which can be a great introduction as well! I am currently teaching myself a lot of server networking & all that stuff. I just believe if you really want to understand how to design algorithms and solve problems in creative ways then the most valuable things you can learn are at the low level. Even though C is 40 years old it is still regarded as producing the most efficient code since you have full control over pointers and memory management with minimal overhead. (the only thing faster is assembly.. an even lower level)

344,HZ5mJK4J5Q,10 Extinct Animals Scientists Are Ready to Bring Back,"Do you know that scientists are almost ready to bring back some species that have been long gone? A T-Rex and other dangerous creatures aren't on the VIP list, so we won't see them in the not-so-distant future. But some of our most beloved characters from the Ice Age movies can be brought back to life!

Instead of using the controversial term ‚Äúcloning,‚Äù scientists prefer to say ‚Äúmake un-extinct.‚Äù To-may-to, to-mah-to, the idea is the same. An animal that died out thousands of years ago can't be brought back to life unless it's cloned. And therein lies the problem. For successful cloning, scientists need to have almost completely undamaged animal DNA. That's why some species are more likely to be resurrected than others. 
 
TIMESTAMPS: 
The woolly mammoth 
The saber-toothed tiger 
The Moa 
The ground sloth 
The dodo 
Woolly rhinoceros 
The Irish elk 
The Baiji river dolphin 
The Siberian unicorn 
The Neanderthal  

Music: 

SUMMARY:
- While most of the woolly mammoths died out about 10,000 years ago, there was a population of about 500 to 1,000 of them living on Wrangel Island as recent as 1650 B.C.E. The woolly mammoth was roughly the size of an African elephant.
- The saber-toothed tiger was about the size of your typical modern-day big cats. It weighed from 200 to 600 pounds and could get up to 13 feet long. The saber-toothed tiger usually had a muscular neck, bobbed tail, powerful front legs, and dagger-like teeth that protruded from the upper jaw and could grow just under a foot long!   
- The moa was a huge flightless bird that looked kinda like an ostrich, minus the wings. We know of about 10 members of the moa family. Some were no bigger than a turkey while others reached a height of 10 feet, making this bird the largest that has ever inhabited our planet.  
- Ground sloths are likely to be successfully resurrected since they were still walking the Earth about 8,000 years ago. Even better, some samples of their DNA have already been received from undamaged hairs of this animal. 
- The dodo became extinct just 80 years after it had been discovered. Its only known habitat was Mauritius Island, where the dodo had been living peacefully for who knows how long until the Dutch showed up in the 1590s.
- Besides the woolly mammoth, there‚Äôs one more fluffy extinct creature, the woolly rhinoceros, that scientists want to bring back. This animal still lived in the Arctic snows pretty recently, about 10,000 years ago. This furry rhino is quite famous too; it often makes an appearance in ancient cave art, like in the French Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc Cave. 
- The Irish elk, also called the giant deer, was one more animal that didn't quite manage to survive the Ice Age. This creature mostly died out about 12,000 years ago. But researchers have discovered Irish elk fossils in Siberia that are only 7,000 to 8,000 years old.  
- The Baiji river dolphin went extinct in 2006, making it the first cetacean (that‚Äôs whales, dolphins, and porpoises) to die out directly due to the negative impact of human activity. It's obvious by now that since the extinction is quite recent, there‚Äôs a sea of DNA samples at hand that make resurrection pretty much a guaranteed success. 
- A Siberian unicorn skull discovered in Kazakhstan proved that the animal had actually disappeared just 29,000 years ago. That‚Äôs good news for people who wanna see a real unicorn someday! 
- Bringing the Neanderthal back would be the easiest task of them all. Scientists already have a map of its genome. It‚Äôs not a question of whether or not we can, but if we should‚Ä¶

Summary:  I built a rock skipping robot with the help of my nieces and nephews to understand the perfect way to skip a rock.  In the end we learned that 4 things matter most:

1) Rock angle of 20 degrees
2) Rock PATH angle of 20 degrees
3) Spin the rock as much as possible
4) Choose a rock that is flat on the bottom and as heavy as possible for you to still get to your max arm speed.

351,r6w2M50_Xdk,Science Saved My Soul.,"Yes, some of the thinkers to whom I owe my mental freedom were religious, like Newton, a Christian who believed God made the Earth - but showed me why the Earth would have formed without a god's help, or Faraday, who opened all our eyes to electromagnetism - and a world of electrons that obey dice, not gods. The brilliance and physical insight of these and many other religious scientists' minds are the very things that make gods getting humans pregnant, or angels whispering to prophets in caves, seem infantile. 

Weird...

....I can see what geniuses said they could not - but then even a mouse on a giant's shoulder sees further if the giant is bowed in prayer.

I'm not against the Creator or Creators, if they exist, if they ever existed. I'm not against the search for the Creator(s). What blows MY mind is that people think organized religion has anything to do with it at all.

Script:

‚Äú97 percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is real.‚Äù

How many times have you heard that statement? Probably hundreds. It may seem like a compelling and scientific argument against fossil fuels, but it‚Äôs one of the most illogical, unscientific arguments you can make. To see how, let‚Äôs use this form of argument for another controversial product, vaccines.

An anti-vaccine person approaches you and says, ‚Äú97 percent of doctors say that the side effects of vaccines are real?‚Äù 

What would you say in response?

You‚Äôd probably say, ‚ÄúYeah but the benefits far outweigh the side effects.‚Äù

By saying that ‚Äú97% of doctors agree that vaccine side effects are real‚Äù without mentioning any of the benefits of vaccines, the anti-vaccine activist is trying to get you to look at the potential dangers of vaccines out of context.  

When fossil fuel opponents say ‚Äú97 percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is real,‚Äù they are doing the same. Yes, using fossil fuels for energy has a side effect‚Äîincreasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Okay. But what about the upside? In the case of fossil fuel that upside is enormous: the cheap, plentiful, and reliable energy that makes modern life possible, and at a scale no other energy source can match.
 
So, how significant is the side effect? This raises another problem with the statement ‚Äú97% percent of climate scientists agree that climate change is real.‚Äù It tells us nothing about the meaning or magnitude of ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a mild, manageable warming or a runaway, catastrophic warming. This is an example of the fallacy of equivocation‚Äîusing the same term in different, contradictory ways.

If someone were to say ‚Äú97% of doctors agree that vaccine side effects are real,‚Äù what exact ‚Äúvaccine side effects‚Äù do the doctors agree on? That a certain number of babies will get a rash? Or that large percentages will get full-blown autism? Precision is key, right?

But fossil fuel opponents don‚Äôt want you to know the precise magnitude of climate change. Because if you did you wouldn‚Äôt be scared of climate change, you would be scared of losing the benefits of fossil fuels.

For example, listen to how Secretary of State John Kerry manipulates the ‚Äú97 percent of scientists‚Äù line. ‚Äú97 percent of climate scientists have confirmed that climate change is happening and that human activity is responsible,‚Äù he said in a speech in Indonesia in 2014. Later, in the same speech, he claimed that Scientists agree that, ‚ÄúThe world as we know it will change‚Äîand it will change dramatically for the worse.‚Äù 97 percent of climate scientists never said any such thing.

A couple of notes on this video:
1. Some people have commented that I should have included computer security alongside hacking, and I completely agree, that was an oversight on my part. Apologies to all the computer security professionals, and thanks for all the hard work!
2. I also failed to mention interpreters alongside compilers in the complier section. Again, I‚Äôm kicking myself because of course this is an important concept for people to hear about. Also the layers of languages being compiled to other languages is overly convoluted, in practice it is more simple than this. I guess I should have picked one simple example.
3. NP-complete problems are possible to solve, they just become very difficult to solve very quickly as they get bigger. When I said NP-complete and then ""impossible to solve"", I meant that the large NP-complete problems that industry is interested in solving were thought to be practically impossible to solve.

Many things are done in the name of science. There is a need to advance our technology, in order to provide food for a growing world population, or to provide medicine and cures for sickness and disease. From see through animals, to clones, and even one wild and crazy idea, take a look at our list of 10 Animals Created by Science. 

10. See Through Frog - Frogs come in nearly every color - from the dull greens, to the vivid yellows and reds of their tropical relatives. Some frogs are even transparent and you can see right through them, which is probably what gave Japanese scientists the idea to create a see through frog by bringing together genes from frogs with unusually pale skin. In these frogs their skin is see through in their early lives. What does this mean?

9. Enviropig ‚Äì This might be a little bit gross but the Enviropig was genetically engineered to produce up to less than 65% phosphorous through its urine and feces. Environmentally, pigs are very destructive to the land they are raised on.

8. Killer Bees ‚Äì You might be thinking that killer bees are a natural species. But, what is little known about these creatures is that they were accidently created by scientists who were trying to increase honey production, and instead ended up with a killer bee. 

7. Super Cows ‚Äì The Belgian Supercow is known as somewhat a mutant breed of cattle. It‚Äôs originas date back to the 1800‚Äôs when Belgian scientists and farmers decided to breed native cattle with Shorthorn cattle. 

6. Genpets ‚Äì OK so this isn‚Äôt a real animal created by scientists, but Genpets needs to be in this list and is probably one of the greatest hoaxes in modern history. 

5. Sterile Pink Bollworm ‚Äì The Pink Bollworm is a serious pest when it comes to cotton farming. Not only do the young larvae inflict damage to the cotton plant by their feeding, they chew through the cotton lint to feed on the seeds.

4. GloFish ‚Äì At first it might not seem like these fish are real, but they are. Glofish are a brand of genetically engineered fluorescent fish. 

3. See-Through Goldfish ‚Äì There are a lot of reasons to genetically engineer creatures such as see through rats, see through frogs, and even see through goldfish. 

2. Dolly the Sheep ‚Äì On July 5th 1996, Dolly the Sheep made biotech history when she became the first animal cloned from adult somatic cells. 

1. Pharmaceutical Camels ‚Äì Many people might not know this but camels milk can be used to produce pharmaceutical proteins used in drugs. And by creating genetically modified camels, it‚Äôs a real inexpensive way to produce it.",Science and Technology

So today, we‚Äôre going to take a look at computing‚Äôs origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we‚Äôve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life.

About this course: 
During each week of the course, you will watch as chefs reveal the secrets behind some of their most famous culinary creations ‚Äî often right in their own restaurants. Inspired by such cooking mastery, the Harvard team will then explain, in simple and sophisticated ways, the science behind the recipe.

Topics will include: soft matter materials, such as emulsions, illustrated by aioli; elasticity, exemplified by the done-ness of a steak; and diffusion, revealed by the phenomenon of spherification, the culinary technique pioneered by Ferran Adri√†.

To help you make the link between cooking and science, an ""equation of the week"" will capture the core scientific concept being explored. You will also have the opportunity to be an experimental scientist in your very own laboratory ‚Äî your kitchen. By following along with the engaging recipe of the week, taking measurements, and making observations, you will learn to think both like a cook and a scientist. The lab is also one of the most unique components of this course ‚Äî after all, in what other science course do you get to eat your lab?

Dr. Noam Chomsky is a famed linguist, political activist, prolific author and recognized public speaker, who has spent the last 60 years living a double life -- one as a political activist and another as a linguist. His activism allegedly made him the US government's public enemy number one. As a linguist he is often credited for dethroning behaviorism and becoming the ""father of modern linguistics"" (and/or cognitive science). Put together his accomplishments are the reasons why he is often listed as one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th century. And so I was very much looking forward to interviewing him on Singularity 1 on 1.

Unfortunately our time together was delayed, then rushed and a bit shorter than anticipated. So I was pretty nervous throughout and messed up some of my questions and timing. Never-the-less, I believe that we still had a worthy conversation with Dr. Chomsky and I appreciate the generous though limited time that he was able to grant me.

During our 28 minute conversation with Noam Chomsky we cover a variety of interesting topics such as: the balance between his academic and his political life; artificial intelligence and reverse engineering the human brain; why in his view both Deep Blue and Watson are little more than PR; the slow but substantial progress of our civilization; the technological singularity...",Science and Technology

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

The Sun is the most powerful force in our solar system.  It generates the heat and light that sustains us.  Without it we wouldn‚Äôt have life on Earth.  But the Sun is violent and volatile and is becoming more dangerous as it ages.

Naked Science explores the life and death of the Sun.  We explore what will happen in the future as the Sun ages, and how our lives linked to the Sun‚Äôs life cycle.

Firstly we want to understand how the Sun was created from a giant cloud of dust and gas.  Scientists pretty much agree on the theory but physical evidence is hard to come by.  Naked Science meets scientists at Johnson Space Center who have been working on a ten year mission to bring a piece of the Sun back to Earth.  How do scientists collect samples of the Sun when a probe could never get near the Sun‚Äôs surface?  We follow NASA‚Äôs dare devil mission to capture the samples.

Today we rely on the Sun to live.  It‚Äôs energy fuels trees and plants which are essential for the food chain we all depend upon.  But how do we get the energy?  Naked Science explores the incredible journey that the particles of light from the Sun have to make to earth to deliver their energy.

How old is the Sun?  This is a question which has fascinated scientists for a long time.  Scientists have now established the Sun‚Äôs age with the aid of one remarkable fact that the Sun sings.  We visit Big Bear Solar Observatory in California to meet one of the scientists who has been at the forefront of using the Sun‚Äôs sounds to determine its age.

The Sun‚Äôs warmth and light helped life on Earth to begin but it can also play havoc with our modern way of life.  Billions of tons of plasma erupting from the sun send powerful storms hurtling through our solar system.  We visit the Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colorado where they try to predict the sun‚Äôs violent moods.  1989 brought one of the most dramatic space storms and Naked Science uncovers the events which took place on the Earth.  But what lies behind the explosive events on the Sun.  We travel to the California Institute of Technology in Los Angeles where they are trying to understand the science behind the explosions by creating them in the laboratory.

But what about the risks of solar storms to astronauts in Space?  Naked Science meets Michael Foale who was directly in the line of fire on the International Space Station during the intense solar activity in 2003.  There is one solar event astronauts can‚Äôt be protected from.  A superflare.  Superflares are up to 10 million times more energetic than the most powerful solar flares.  Naked Science journeys to Louisiana to meet an astrophysicist who has found evidence of nine stars that have experienced superflares.  What if our sun ever produced a superflare, what would happen to life on earth?

We know when the sun was born, how it nurtured us and how it has thrown a fair amount of danger our way.  But how and when will it die and will the Earth survive?",Science and Technology

Last week's video: Climate Science - What You Need to Know 

Scientists overwhelmingly agree that our climate is changing, Earth is getting warmer, sea levels are rising, and it's primarily because of humans putting lots of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Yet 4 in 10 Americans aren't convinced
Here's what psychologists and sociologists have to say about why some people don't believe in climate science.

410,65e2qScV_K8,The science of emotions: Jaak Panksepp at TEDxRainier,"Given an inherent subjective nature, emotions have long been a nearly impenetrable topic for scientific research. Affective neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp explains a modern approach to emotions, and how taking seriously the emotions of other animals might soon improve the lives of millions. 

Jaak Panksepp introduced the concept of Affective Neuroscience in 1990, consisting of an overarching vision of how mammalian brains generate experienced affective states in animals, as effective models for fathoming the primal evolutionary sources of emotional feelings in human beings. This work has implications for further developments in Biological Psychiatry, ranging from an understanding of the underlying brain disorders, to new therapeutic strategies. Panksepp is a Ph.D. Professor and Baily Endowed Chair of Animal Well-Being Science, College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University. His scientific contributions include more than 400 papers devoted to the study of basic emotional and motivational processes of the mammalian brain. He has conducted extensive research on brain and bodily mechanisms of feeding and energy-balance regulation, sleep physiology, and most importantly the study of emotional processes, including associated feelings states, in other animals. 

This talk was given November 9, 2013 in Seattle at TEDxRainier, a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. 

TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Science and Technology

Script:

In 1966 Time magazine ran a cover story asking: ""Is God Dead?"" The cover reflected the fact that many people had accepted the cultural narrative that God is obsolete -- that, as science progresses there is less need for a ""God"" to explain the universe.  It turns out, though, that the rumors of God's death were premature. In fact, perhaps the best arguments for his existence come from -- of all places  -- science itself.

Here's the story: The same year Time featured its now-famous headline, the astronomer Carl Sagan announced that there were two necessary criteria for a planet to support life: The right kind of star, and a planet the right distance from that star. Given the roughly octillion planets in the universe -- that's 1 followed by 24 zeros -- there should have been about septillion planets -- that's 1 followed by 21 zeros -- capable of supporting life.

With such spectacular odds, scientists were optimistic that the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, known by its initials, SETI, an ambitious project launched in the 1960's, was sure to turn up something soon. With a vast radio telescopic network, scientists listened for signals that resembled coded intelligence. But as the years passed, the silence from the universe was deafening. As of 2014, researchers have discovered precisely bubkis, nada, zilch, which is to say zero followed by an infinite number of zeros.

What happened? As our knowledge of the universe increased, it became clear that there were, in fact, far more factors necessary for life -- let alone intelligent life -- than Sagan supposed. His two parameters grew to 10, then 20, and then 50, which meant that the number of potentially life-supporting planets decreased accordingly.  The number dropped to a few thousand planets and kept on plummeting.

Even SETI proponents acknowledged the problem. Peter Schenkel wrote in a 2006 piece for Skeptical Inquirer, a magazine that strongly affirms atheism: ""In light of new findings and insights . . . . We should quietly admit that the early estimates . . . may no longer be tenable.""

Today there are more than 200 known parameters necessary for a planet to support life--every single one of which must be perfectly met, or the whole thing falls apart. For example, without a massive, gravity-rich planet like Jupiter nearby to draw away asteroids, Earth would be more like an interstellar dartboard than the verdant orb that it is.  

Simply put, the odds against life in the universe are astonishing.

Yet here we are, not only existing, but talking about existing. What can account for it? Can every one of those many parameters have been perfectly met by accident? At what point is it fair to admit that it is science itself that suggests that we cannot be the result of random forces?  Doesn't assuming that an intelligence created these perfect conditions in fact require far less faith than believing that a life-sustaining Earth just happened to beat the inconceivable odds?

435,Ia55clAtdM,Teaching creative computer science: Simon Peyton Jones at TEDxExeter,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Simon Peyton Jones wants children not just to consume technology, but to be creative with it. What does that mean for teaching computer science in schools, and why is the rest of the world watching England?

Simon Peyton Jones is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge. His research focus is in programming language design and implementation, and the purely-functional language Haskell in particular. He is a founder member and current chair of the Computing at School working group, which has played a central role in the recent reform of the school Computing curriculum.

At TEDxExeter 2014 our speakers and performers connected us with other worlds. Our talks exposed corruption in big business, shared effective approaches to tackling social inequality and gave a voice to those whose human rights are under threat. We explored the impact of fast changing technologies on all our lives. We journeyed through fire and forest to frozen landscapes. We were challenged to consider worlds of extremes, cutting edge controversies and risky opportunities.

If you must compare them to any other groups, I think Madness would come close; Not so much for musical styling as for their composition. Both groups were mini-orchestras, and to see them on stage was to behold brilliant chaos. 
Musically, they were one of a kind. Sonically bright and cheerful, lyrically questioning and slightly morbid, they were at the forefront of what became known as New Wave.
To those who are not familiar with their songs, they can be intimidating and strange (think Sparks, if you're familiar with them).

Social anthropologist Jean Smith, or ‚Äòflirtologist‚Äô if you will, demonstrates her 6 simple steps known as ‚ÄúH.O.T.  A.P.E.‚Äù to help answer that very question. And it will forever change your perception of flirting from being a stranger‚Äôs evaluation of your worth into what it should be: a fun game! 

Jean's purpose in life is understanding how people flirt. And people flirt differently in different cultures. She uses her background as a  cultural and social anthropologist to help teach people how to flirt ‚Äì to gain confidence and happiness in their lives by assisting them to projective a positive image of themselves. , she uses research and  studies to emphasize the skills that we can all learn to interact more effectively. Jean also uses practical activities and interaction to bridge the brain and the body and apply the information to make our daily lives more rewarding. The basis of Jeans teachings comes from her background as a social anthropologist.. A few years ago, Jean published, The Flirt Interpreter, which is an accessible analysis of the research she conducted into the flirting behaviour of people in the cities of London, New York, Paris and Stockholm. She conducted 250 face-to-face interviews to ascertain flirting behaviour.

Lyrics:

[deGrasse Tyson]
We are all connected;
To each other, biologically
To the earth, chemically
To the rest of the universe atomically

[Feynman]
I think nature's imagination
Is so much greater than man's
She's never going to let us relax

[Sagan]
We live in an in-between universe
Where things change all right
But according to patterns, rules,
Or as we call them, laws of nature

[Nye]
I'm this guy standing on a planet
Really I'm just a speck
Compared with a star, the planet is just another speck
To think about all of this
To think about the vast emptiness of space
There's billions and billions of stars
Billions and billions of specks

[Sagan]
The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
But the way those atoms are put together
The cosmos is also within us
We're made of star stuff
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself

Across the sea of space
The stars are other suns
We have traveled this way before
And there is much to be learned

I find it elevating and exhilarating
To discover that we live in a universe
Which permits the evolution of molecular machines
As intricate and subtle as we

[deGrasse Tyson]
I know that the molecules in my body are traceable
To phenomena in the cosmos
That makes me want to grab people in the street
And say, have you heard this??

(Richard Feynman on hand drums and chanting)

[Feynman]
There's this tremendous mess
Of waves all over in space
Which is the light bouncing around the room
And going from one thing to the other

And it's all really there
But you gotta stop and think about it
About the complexity to really get the pleasure
And it's all really there
The inconceivable nature of nature",Science and Technology

One of Tara's biggest dreams comes true - she gets to light Anthony on fire! Luckily, Anthony has science on his side. 

Watch Hard Science on your mobile device by downloading the new TestTube iOS app here! 

Materials Needed:
- FireIce Polymer Gel
- Sterno Ethanol Gel
- Magnesium Ribbon
- Blow Torch/Lighter
- Water Bucket & Hose

Experiment & Safety Tips:
- This experiment can be very dangerous and cause serious burns, DO NOT attempt unless you have professional supervision! 
- We used gel fuel because liquid fuel would absorb into the polymer.
- Keep a full bucket of water and hose ready to extinguish the fire. 

Fire Gel Fights House Fires

Fire retardant gel breaks the fire triangle by suffocating the oxygen from the fuel by cooling the heat source, thus breaking the thermal barriers of fire. 

How It Works

When the water-saturated gel is encountered, the heat energy from the fire is redirected and is consumed by first having to drive out all of the entrapped water as steam. This prevents the heat from building up to the point of combustion in the surrounding materials.

Magnesium

Finely divided magnesium readily ignites upon heating in air and burns with a bright white flame.

Lyrics:

I'll be the spark, if you'll be the flame
Start a reaction that can't be contained
Balance your pH by sharing my base
I'll be your star, if you'll be my space

'Cause there is no distance that I wouldn't go
Through spacetime and wormholes my matter would flow
To the edge of the universe

I'll be your G, if you will be C
Or I can be A, if you will be T
If there's a mutation I'll fix every base
Working as your zinc finger nuclease

Just like an atom, don't rip us apart
Unless you want a big BOOM in my heart

We can take it fast or really slow
But we can't know with certainty where we'll go
If at first we don't succeed, we'll try two more times
So our failure's a statistically significant try

Like an equation, it all works out
If we balance the sides there's no need to doubt

CHORUS:
This is your science love song
A place to start our chemical bond
A research endeavour
We can write the conclusion together

Just like the movies I'd steal your heart
But then you'd die...so I won't do that

If we broke up I'd be no more
I'd give up H2O for H2SO4
Take away gravity, I'd still fall for you
Share my last electron in a covalent bond for two

'Cause you're like that angle, A-cute and you're smart
Your labcoat and goggles go straight to my heart
Except that's a lie, cause the heart doesn't feel
When it comes to love the brain seals the deal

REPEAT CHORUS

In today‚Äôs episode, we‚Äôre going to unpack these three goals and talk through some strategies we use like passwords, biometrics, and access privileges to keep our information as secure, but also as accessible as possible. From massive Denial of Service, or DDos attacks, to malware and brute force password cracking there are a lot of ways for hackers to gain access to your data, so we‚Äôll also discuss some strategies like creating strong passwords, and using 2-factor authentication, to keep your information safe.

Is string theory right?
Is it just fantasy?
Caught in the landscape,
Out of touch with reality
Compactified
On S5 or T*S3

Space is a pure void
Why should it be stringy? 
Because it's quantum not classical
Nonrenormalizable
Any way you quantize
You'll encounter infinity
You see

Quanta
Must interact
Via paths we understand
Using Feynman diagrams
Often, they will just rebound
But now and then they go another way
A quantum
Loooooop
Infinities will make you cry
Unless you can renormalize your model
Of baryons, fermions
And all other states of matter

Curved space:
The graviton
Can be thought of as a field
But these infinities are real
In a many-body
Loop diagram
Our results diverge no matter what we do...
A Quantum Soup (any way you quantize)
Kiss your fields goodbye
Guess Einstein's theory wasn't complete at all!

I see extended 1-D objects with no mass
What's their use? What's their use? Can they give us quark plasma?
What to minimize?
What functional describes this
String?
Nambu-Goto! (Nambu-Goto)
Nambu-Goto! (Nambu-Goto)
How to quantize I don't know
Polyakov!
I'm just a worldsheet, please minimize me
He's just a worldsheet from a string theory
Reperametrized by a Weyl symmetry!

Fermi, Bose, open, closed, orientable?
Vibrations
Modes! They become particles (particles!)
Vibrations
They become particles (particles!)
Vibrations
They become particles (particles!)
Become particles (particles!)
Become particles (many many many many particle...)
Modes modes modes modes modes modes modes!
Oh mamma mia mamma mia,
Such a sea of particles!
A tachyon, with a dilaton and gravity-vity-VITY

(rock out!)

Now we need ten dimensions and I'll tell you why
(anomaly cancellation!)
So to get down to 4D we compactify!
Oh, Kahler!
(Kahler manifold)
Manifolds must be Kahler!
(Complex Reimannian symplectic form)
If we wanna preserve
Any of our super-symmetry

(Superstrings of type I, IIa and IIb)
(Heterotic O and Heterotic E)
(All are one through S and T duality)
(Thank you Ed Witten for that superstring revolution and your new M-theory!)

(Maldecena!)
(Super-Yang-Mills!)
(Type IIB String!)
Dual! Dual!
(In the AdS/CFT)
(Holography!)

Molecules and atoms
Light and energy
Time and space and matter
All from one united
Theory

Any way you quantize...

463,HUGEWoGM_1U,Science knows no borders.,"Global collaboration lies at the heart of scientific discoveries.  The enthusiasm and motivation to explore the fundamental laws of our Universe knows no geographical or cultural borders.  

CERN was born on 29 September 1954, with a dual mandate to provide excellent science, and to bring nations together. Today it is the largest particle physics laboratory in the world and a prime example of international collaboration, bringing together scientists of almost 100 nationalities.

This blueprint for collaboration has worked remarkably well over the years and expanded to all the continents.

This project is co-funded by the European Union under the Horizon 2020 programme.",Science and Technology
464,S20NcDLF_t4,Hardest Computer Science Course Explained | Angel of Death UoG,"Since you guys really liked the last computer science video I decided to talk about my hardest CS course, nicknamed the ""angel of death"" at my school. It has a notoriously high fail rate for its assignments. You can expect to write a few thousand lines of C code in the first two assignments. This year we made a GEDCOM parser (which is actually what ancestry.com uses) to store information about family histories, allowing us to perform operations on family connections. In the second assignment we wrote a GEDCOM file writer, to create a GEDCOM file out of the memory objects. In the third assignment we used Node js and express to create a RESTful web server and UI for interacting with our parser. I tried to explain the file structure as best I could in a few minutes, so it will probably be very confusing to watch at first. The goal is to show you the complexities of the file structure, and how we built this web application to interface with our C API. This is basically how large scale cloud computing applications are made such as YouTube and Facebook.

GEDCOM Standard: 

The point I want to make is that this course is not as ""hard"" as everybody makes it out to be. Just dedicate at least two weeks to the assignment and you will be fine. None of the algorithms or data structures were difficult, rather it was the massive amount of errors possible when writing such a parser from scratch. There are thousands of tags and conditions if you want to create a full parser and identify everything listed in the standard. Thankfully we only implemented about half of the full parser seen on the standard (link above).

|| Technologies used ||

GEDCOM Parser API:
- C

Web server:
- Node js with express framework
- RESTful server, ajax, JSON
- JavaScript

Client:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

468,Jm-upHSP9KU,Oingo Boingo - Weird Science,"1985) For most of the 80's Oingo Boingo was to L.A. and Orange County what the Grateful Dead was to San Francisco. Oingo Boingo developed the kind of fan following that made every appearance an event. They were ""our band"", and we believed they knew and appreciated our enthusiasm. 
If you must compare them to any other groups, I think Madness would come close; Not so much for musical styling as for their composition. Both groups were mini-orchestras, and to see them on stage was to behold brilliant chaos. 
Musically, they were one of a kind. Sonically bright and cheerful, lyrically questioning and slightly morbid, they were at the forefront of what became known as New Wave.
To those who are not familiar with their songs, they can be intimidating and strange (think Sparks, if you're familiar with them). 
Their most accessible songs are Dead Man's Party, Weird Science and I Love Little Girls: listen to these a couple of times and the rest of their catalog will come easier.

471,5cQoGNEcc5Q,The Science of Flirting: Being a H.O.T. A.P.E. | Jean Smith | TEDxLSHTM,"Is this person flirting with me? This question has plagued us from nearly the beginning of time. Social anthropologist Jean Smith, or ‚Äòflirtologist‚Äô if you will, demonstrates her 6 simple steps known as ‚ÄúH.O.T.  A.P.E.‚Äù to help answer that very question. And it will forever change your perception of flirting from being a stranger‚Äôs evaluation of your worth into what it should be: a fun game! 

Jean's purpose in life is understanding how people flirt. And people flirt differently in different cultures. She uses her background as a  cultural and social anthropologist to help teach people how to flirt ‚Äì to gain confidence and happiness in their lives by assisting them to projective a positive image of themselves. , she uses research and  studies to emphasize the skills that we can all learn to interact more effectively. Jean also uses practical activities and interaction to bridge the brain and the body and apply the information to make our daily lives more rewarding. The basis of Jeans teachings comes from her background as a social anthropologist.. A few years ago, Jean published, The Flirt Interpreter, which is an accessible analysis of the research she conducted into the flirting behaviour of people in the cities of London, New York, Paris and Stockholm. She conducted 250 face-to-face interviews to ascertain flirting behaviour.

Lyrics:

[deGrasse Tyson]
We are all connected;
To each other, biologically
To the earth, chemically
To the rest of the universe atomically

[Feynman]
I think nature's imagination
Is so much greater than man's
She's never going to let us relax

[Sagan]
We live in an in-between universe
Where things change all right
But according to patterns, rules,
Or as we call them, laws of nature

[Nye]
I'm this guy standing on a planet
Really I'm just a speck
Compared with a star, the planet is just another speck
To think about all of this
To think about the vast emptiness of space
There's billions and billions of stars
Billions and billions of specks

[Sagan]
The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
But the way those atoms are put together
The cosmos is also within us
We're made of star stuff
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself

Across the sea of space
The stars are other suns
We have traveled this way before
And there is much to be learned

I find it elevating and exhilarating
To discover that we live in a universe
Which permits the evolution of molecular machines
As intricate and subtle as we

[deGrasse Tyson]
I know that the molecules in my body are traceable
To phenomena in the cosmos
That makes me want to grab people in the street
And say, have you heard this??

(Richard Feynman on hand drums and chanting)

[Feynman]
There's this tremendous mess
Of waves all over in space
Which is the light bouncing around the room
And going from one thing to the other

And it's all really there
But you gotta stop and think about it
About the complexity to really get the pleasure
And it's all really there
The inconceivable nature of nature",Science and Technology
