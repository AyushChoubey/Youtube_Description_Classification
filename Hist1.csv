The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother’s side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun’s triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

13,Ei_JGATir2Y,Archaeology : India The First Civilization Documentary,"As Indian independence approached in the first half of the 20th century, British archaeologists John Hubert Marshall and Sir Mortimer Wheeler worked at breakneck speed to understand the great ancient civilisations of the subcontinent, which the British Empire had ruled for a mere 200 years. The British archaeologists and their Indian colleagues succeeded in identifying the Indus civilisation, a sophisticated culture up to 4000 years old whose towns and cities built of clay bricks extended over a vast area - apparently without the use of a written language. But as they worked on, in peace and then in war, the archaeologists found themselves faced with a familiar question. Was this advanced Indus civilisation peaceful, or was it forged and maintained through cruel wars?",History

22,kq_8FeQTaA,How Much of Indian History Is Really True? | Sanjeev Sanyal,"""It is no secret that conquering cultures peg themselves as ‘superior’ and denounce everything that came before them as an ‘age of darkness’. Equally true is the African proverb, “As long as the lions do not have their storytellers, history will always glorify the hunter”.

We Indians know intuitively that the history imposed on us is not our history at all. It is the history of invaders glorifying their invasions. And yet, for over 70 years of independence, we Indians have not managed to cleanse the biases of the colonial imposition of history on us. Sanjeev Sanyal makes a case for telling Indian history the way it happened to us - from the perspective of Indians.

Sanjeev is an Indian writer, environmentalist and urbanist, who is considered as one of the world's leading financial sector economists. Sanjeev was the Global Strategist and Managing Director at Deutsche Bank till Oct 2015. He is also the author of three best-selling books, including the ""Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's Geography.""

29,RqLZLFw96hE,History of India (Hindi) प्राचीन भारत का इतिहास,"The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; the later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.",History

36,diMuXXJ_m7E,Interesting Facts about the Khajuraho Temple || khajuraho temple history in hindi |Khajuraho Temple,"""Khajuraho"" redirects here. For the town, see
Khajuraho (town) . For the constituency, see
Khajuraho (Lok Sabha constituency) .
The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a group of
Hindu , Buddhist and Jain temples in Madhya Pradesh , India, about 175 kilometres (109 mi) southeast of Jhansi . They are one of the UNESCO
World Heritage Sites in India. [1][2] The temples are famous for their nagara -style architectural symbolism and their erotic sculptures . [3]
Most Khajuraho temples were built between 950 and 1050 by the Chandela Rajput dynasty. [4] Historical records note that the Khajuraho temple site had 85 temples by the 12th century, spread over 20 square kilometers Of these, only about 25 temples have survived, spread over 6 square kilometers. [2] Of the various surviving temples, the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple is decorated with a profusion of sculptures with intricate details, symbolism and expressiveness of ancient Indian art. [5]
The Khajuraho group of temples were built together but were dedicated to two religions, Hinduism and
Jainism , suggesting a tradition of acceptance and respect for diverse religious views among Hindus and Jains in the region. [6]
Location
The Khajuraho monuments are located in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh , in Chhatarpur district , about 620 kilometres (385 mi) southeast of New Delhi.The temples are located near a small town also known as Khajuraho, [7] with a population of about 20,000 people (2001 Census).
Khajuraho is served by Civil Aerodrome Khajuraho (IATA Code: HJR), with services to Delhi, Agra, Varanasi and Mumbai. [8] The site is also linked by the Indian Railways service, with the railway station located approximately six kilometres from the entrance to the monuments .
The monuments are about 10 kilometres off the east-west National Highway 75 , and about 50 kilometres from the city of Chhatarpur , which is connected to the state capital Bhopal by the SW-NE running
National Highway 86 .
The 10th century Bhand Deva Temple in Rajasthan was built in the style of the Khajuraho monuments and is often referred to as 'Little Khajuraho'.
History
The Khajuraho group of monuments was built during the rule of the Chandela dynasty. The building activity started almost immediately after the rise of their power, throughout their kingdom to be later known as Bundelkhand . [9] Most temples were built during the reigns of the Hindu kings Yashovarman and Dhanga . Yashovarman's legacy is best exhibited by The Lakshmana Temple . Vishvanatha temple best highlights King Dhanga's reign. [10] :22 The largest and currently most famous surviving temple is Kandariya Mahadeva built in the reign of King
Vidyadhara . [11] The temple inscriptions suggest many of the currently surviving temples were complete between 970 and 1030 CE, with further temples completed during the following decades. [6]
The Khajuraho temples were built about 35 miles from the medieval city of Mahoba, [12] the capital of the Chandela dynasty, in the Kalinjar region. In ancient and medieval literature, their kingdom has been referred to as Jijhoti, Jejahoti, Chih-chi-to and Jejakabhukti. [13]
Khajuraho was mentioned by Abu Rihan-al-Biruni ,

Khajuraho was mentioned by Abu Rihan-al-Biruni , the Persian historian who accompanied Mahmud of Ghazni in his raid of Kalinjar in 1022 CE; he mentions Khajuraho as the capital of Jajahuti. [14] The raid was unsuccessful, and a peace accord was reached when the Hindu king agreed to pay a ransom to Mahmud of Ghazni to end the attack and leave.

98,DCF7G-yZZGQ,Subhash Chandra Bose | Audio Biography In Hindi | Indian History Channel,"Subhas Chandra Bose  was an Indian nationalist whose defiant patriotism made him a hero in India but whose attempt during World War II to rid India of British rule with the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japanleft a troubled legacy. Bose had been a leader of the younger, radical, wing of the Indian National Congress in the late 1920s and 1930s, rising to become Congress President in 1938 and 1939.  However, he was ousted from Congress leadership positions in 1939 following differences with Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress high command. He was subsequently placed under house arrest by the British before escaping from India in 1940. Bose arrived in Germany in April 1941, where the leadership offered unexpected, if sometimes ambivalent, sympathy for the cause of India's independence, contrasting starkly with its attitudes towards other colonised peoples and ethnic communities. In November 1941, with German funds, a Free India Centre was set up in Berlin, and soon a Free India Radio, on which Bose broadcast nightly. A 3,000-strong Free India Legion, comprising Indians captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, was also formed to aid in a possible future German land invasion of India.  By spring 1942, in light of Japanese victories in southeast Asia and changing German priorities, a German invasion of India became untenable, and Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia. Adolf Hitler, during his only meeting with Bose in late May 1942, suggested the same, and offered to arrange for a submarine.During this time Bose also became a father; his wife, or companion, Emilie Schenkl, whom he had met in 1934, gave birth to a baby girl in November 1942.  Identifying strongly with the Axis powers, and no longer apologetically, Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943. In Madagascar, he was transferred to a Japanese submarine from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May 1943.

With Japanese support, Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA), then composed of Indian soldiers of the British Indian army who had been captured in the Battle of Singapore. To these, after Bose's arrival, were added enlisting Indian civilians in Malaya and Singapore. The Japanese had come to support a number of puppet and provisional governments in the captured regions, such as those in Burma, the Philippines and Manchukuo. Before long the Provisional Government of Free India, presided by Bose, was formed in the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Bose had great drive and charisma—creating popular Indian slogans, such as ""Jai Hind,""—and the INA under Bose was a model of diversity by region, ethnicity, religion, and even gender. However, Bose was regarded by the Japanese as being militarily unskilled,  and his military effort was short-lived. In late 1944 and early 1945 the British Indian Army first halted and then devastatingly reversed the Japanese attack on India. Almost half the Japanese forces and fully half the participating INA contingent were killed.  The INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula, and surrendered with the recapture of Singapore. Bose had earlier chosen not to surrender with his forces or with the Japanese, but rather to escape to Manchuria with a view to seeking a future in the Soviet Union which he believed to be turning anti-British. He died from third degree burns received when his plane crashed in Taiwan. Some Indians, however, did not believe that the crash had occurred,[6][o] with many among them, especially in Bengal, believing that Bose would return to gain India's independence.The Indian National Congress, the main instrument of Indian nationalism, praised Bose's patriotism but distanced itself from his tactics and ideology, especially his collaboration with fascism. The British Raj, though never seriously threatened by the INA, charged 300 INA officers with treason in the INA trials, but eventually backtracked in the face both of popular sentiment and of its own end.",History

Also known as Kautilya or Vishnugupta, he authored the great political treatise, the Arthashastra. His great work was lost at the end of Gupta empire, and found later in early 20th century. He served as the chief advisor to both emperors Chandragupta and his son Bindusara.

129,AGk9UQJBZwY,Pandya Dynasty - Dynasties of Ancient India | History for Kids | Educational Videos by Mocomi,"https://mocomi.com/ presents: The exciting history of the Pandyas

Pandya Dynasty, was an ancient Tamil dynasty which ruled parts of South India until the 15th century AD.

One of the three ancient kingdoms in the south of India was the Pandyan Kingdom who ruled over Tamil Nadu until the end of the fifteenth century.

Korkai, a seaport on the southernmost tip of India was initially their capital, but then later the capital was moved to Madurai.

The Pandyan Empire was established by the Emperor Kadungon in the sixth century. He ascended the throne after defeating the clan of Kalabhras.

The Pandyas grew in strength and expanded their kingdom. Tamil Nadu was divided between the Pallavas and the Pandyas. The river Kaveri acted as a boundary between the two kingdoms.

The Pandyas controlled the districts which are known as Madurai and Tirunalveli today as well as parts of Southern Kerala.

The Pandyas were best known for their extensive trade network which spread as far as Rome and Greece. They excelled in trading though the seas from Dhanushkodi, the sea shore of Ramanathapuram, and Poompuhar, a city which was used to trade with China, Malaysia, Maldives and other. The Pandyas controlled the pearl fisheries along the South Indian coast between Sri Lanka and India, producing some of the finest pearls known.

Buy the History of Hindu India Textbook: 

The History of Hindu India (Part Three) was developed by the editors of Hinduism Today magazine in collaboration with Dr. Shiva Bajpai, Professor Emeritus of History, California State University Northridge. It is intended to provide an authentic presentation of the history of India and Hinduism for use in American middle and high school classes, as well as Hindu temple study groups and general presentations on the Hindu religion and history.

This documentary is based on the third chapter of the textbook, ""The History of Hindu India,"" published in 2011. It covers Indian history from 1100 to 1850 ce, from the Arab Muslim invasions to British rule, a time of great difficulty for the Indian people. These extensive foreign invasions are recounted, including the plunder of the great Siva temple at Somnath, and the establishment of the Mughal Empire by the 16th century in most of India, its subsequent decline by the mid-18th century and the gradual control of India by the British. The documentary provides an account of the saints of the powerful Bhakti Movement, including Ramananda and Kabir. One section is devoted to an overview of the Sikh religion, from its founding in the 16th century by Guru Nanak to formation of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in the 18th century. This is followed by a brief introduction to Indian music and its basic concepts of tala (rhythm), raga (scale) and improvisation. 

For more information and for class lesson plans based on the book, visit www.hinduismtoday.com/education/. This documentary is directed and produced by Sushma Khadepaun; produced and narrated by Roger (Raj) Narayan.

Rajiv Dixit was an Indian Orator. He started social movements in order to spread awareness on topics of Indian national interest through the Swadeshi Movement, Azadi Bachao Andolan and various other works. He served as the National Secretary of Bharat Swabhiman Andolan he was also founder of Bharat Swabhimaan Andolan. He was a strong believer and preacher of Bharatiyata. He had also worked for spreading awareness about Indian history, issues in the Indian constitution and Indian economic policies. He was also Indian scientist and very few people know that he has worked with APJ Abdul Kalam. Being a Scientist he could have enjoyed his life very well in USA or UK but he sacrificed his life to bring awareness among the People against Black money, Loot of Multinational Companies, Corruptions, Benefits of Indian made items and Ayurveda. He was struggling past 20 years against multinational companies and wants to protect Indian freedom. 

राजीव दीक्षित एक भारतीय वक्ता थे। उन्होंने स्वदेशी आंदोलन, आजादी बचाओ आंदोलन और विभिन्न अन्य कार्यों के माध्यम से राष्ट्रीय हित के विषयों पर जागरूकता फैलाने के लिए सामाजिक आंदोलनों शुरू किये थे। वो भारत स्वाभिमान आन्दोलन के संस्थापक और राष्ट्रीय सचिव भी रह चुके हैं। राजीव दीक्षित भारतीयता के उपदेशक थे। उन्होंने भारतीय इतिहास, संविधान में मुद्दों और आर्थिक नीतियों के बारे में जागरूकता फैलाने के लिए काम किया था। राजीव दीक्षित एक भारतीय वैज्ञानिक थे और बहुत कम लोगों को पता है कि वह एपीजे अब्दुल कलाम के साथ भी काम कर चुके है। एक वैज्ञानिक होने के नाते अगर वह चाहते तो अमेरिका या ब्रिटेन में बहुत अच्छी तरह से अपने जीवन का आनंद ले सकते थे लेकिन उन्होने अपने जीवन का बलिदान काले धन, बहुराष्ट्रीय कंपनियों की लूट, भ्रष्टाचार, भारतीय वस्तुओं का लाभ और आयुर्वेद के लिए जागरूकता लाने के लिए दिया। उन्होने बहुराष्ट्रीय कंपनियों के खिलाफ संघर्ष और भारतीय स्वतंत्रता की रक्षा करने में अपनी ज़िन्दगी के 20 साल लगा दिए।",History

We present our INDIAN HISTORY lessons!

* INDIAN HISTORY - Great Religions of the World - Jainism I *

Jainism is considered a non-theistic Indian religion founded in the 6th century BC as a reaction against the teachings of Vedic Hinduism. It teaches the virtues of non-violence in all its forms, and salvation by perfection through successive lives. Jainism does not believe in God as a creator, survivor, and destroyer of the universe. A person can indeed become a liberated soul, and reach the state of bliss called moksha.

We trace these footprints on the sands of time with our series!

167,inkLN-iyqiU,Vijayanagar Empire - Hampi | Medieval Indian History | NCERT Video | medieval history | UPSC | PCS |,"It was the only Hindu Kingdom founded by Harihara and Bukka, during the times of Mohammad Bin Tughlaq when Sultan was at the stage of downfall and many revolts took place in Kampili. Harihara and Bukka were feudatories of Warangal King Pratap Rudra Dev II
In 1323, MBT destroyed Warangal and during this time Harihara and Bukka went to Kampili to assist Kampil Dev and became ministers there. When the power of Sultan became weak, they revolted and they were reconverted into Hinduism by their Guru Vidhyaranya. So they founded Vidyanagar Kingdom after the name of their Guru which later became ‘Vijaynagar’.
They started ‘Sangam Dynasty’ after the name of their father Sangam.

Timur Lang, the Turk, swooped down from the north and smashed up the Delhi Sultanate. After this terrible affliction, North India remained weak and divided into small potentates. But South India was comparatively well off with Vijaynagar as the largest and most powerful of the southern kingdoms. This state and the city attracted many Hindu refugees from the north. From contemporary accounts, it appears that the city was incredibly rich and beautiful. Said Abdur-Razzak, a traveller from Central Asia: The city is such that eye has not seen nor ear heard of any palace resembling it upon the whole earth. There were arcades and magnificent galleries for the bazaars, and rising above them all was the palace of the king, surrounded by many rivulets and streams flowing through channels of cut stone. In the widespread kingdom, many temples were built with the king emerging to represent godhead. The haughty Kalinga prince’s duel with the Malaysian swordsman resulted in the former’s defeat, followed by suicide. Bijapur’s recalcitrant rebel Adil Khan is subjugated. The ageing king was taken ill and his attempts to fix the succession issue prove futile, with the vast empire showing signs of decay. Even when the Deccan kings began teaming up among themselves, the sprawling empire refused to read the signs on the wall.


The Medieval history of India is a vast topic which students generally feel difficult to cover and moreover the complete notes for ancient history for IAS exam and other State civil services exam is very less available on internet and students generally feel boredom to cover it from internet. So in this video, I have tried to make the concepts interesting with the help of interesting stories associated with different empires, civilizations and persons. I have used my own personal and class notes so that the students who are not getting IAS or UPSC or PSC coaching from anywhere can take advantage from my videos. I hope the video will benefit to all the students who are preparing for any kind of competitive examination especially UPSC and State Civil services. I hope you will definitely like my video and if does please also SUBSCRIBE to my channel.

Failure of Cripps India Mission(Immediate Cause)

Japan was advancing towards India and the fall of India to Japan was imminent. Gandhi ji warned that only a free India could defend herself and he urged for the right of self-determination to Indians.

Rise of Prices of Commodities due to world war II

Congress & Quit India Movement

The Congress Working Committee met at Wardha on 14th July 1942 and adopted the famous “Quit India Resolution”

This resolution was ratified in the All India Congress Committee at Bombay on August 7, 1942. Here a nonviolent mass struggle under the leadership of Gandhi was sanctioned in the “August Kranti Maidan”.”

Gandhi JI Said “Do or Die”

Features of Quit India Movement

Not a Non-violent Movement 

Not led by Gandhi 

Not Planned

Why Quit India Movement Failed?

The Quit India Movement was not supported by the Muslim League and the Communists. 

Major Leaders of Congress was arrested by British including Gandhi JI

Jinnah and the Muslim League, as well as Congress opponents like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha sought to gain political mileage, criticizing Gandhi and the Congress Party.

Lack of co-ordination among the Congress people agitating in different parts of the country. 

There was absence of a clear cut programme of action. 

it was confined only to students, peasants and lower middle class. But the upper middle class had lost their faith in the Gandhian methods of action.",History

* INDIAN HISTORY - Great Religions of the World - Jainism I *

Jainism is considered a non-theistic Indian religion founded in the 6th century BC as a reaction against the teachings of Vedic Hinduism. It teaches the virtues of non-violence in all its forms, and salvation by perfection through successive lives. Jainism does not believe in God as a creator, survivor, and destroyer of the universe. A person can indeed become a liberated soul, and reach the state of bliss called moksha.

We trace these footprints on the sands of time with our series!

In this two-part special, 101 East traces the events and conflicting politics that led to the greatest migration of people in human history and unleashed a wave of communal violence that claimed more than a million lives.  

The Partition sparked three wars, the birth of Bangladesh, and transformed Kashmir into the world's most militarised zone. 

As tensions between India and Pakistan persist, 101 East explores the Partition's troubled legacy and the unresolved geopolitics between the two nuclear powers.

263,D8pJjLmaYE,Harshavardhana Kingdom Story - Kings of India | History for Kids | Educational Videos by Mocomi,"https://mocomi.com/ presents - King Harshavardhana - Kings of India

A story of the Indian emperor who ruled northern India.

The downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle of the sixth century brought about the breakup of the northern Indian kingdom into many small republics and monarchy states. Punjab and parts of central India had been taken over by the Huns regime, however over time, their power weakened as they assimilated with the native population.

Prabhakar Vardhan, ruler of Sthanvisvara, Thanesar (in present day Haryana) was the first ruler of the Vardhana dynasty. He had two sons. The elder son Rajya Vardhana ascended the throne after his father. His younger son was Harshavardhana.

Rajya Vardhana was deceived and murdered by King Gauda, at which point a young sixteen year old Harsha swore to take revenge. Harsha waged war against King Gauda and won the battle.

To get Ancient and Medieval history ppts (in PDF format) and Punjab related video ppts through pendrive, students can contact @98555-99098 (Harsimranjeet Singh) or email at navneet.bhangu123@gmail.com This video gives explanation on Slave Dynasty. First dynasty was established by a slave, so it was called as SLAVE DYNASTY. Aibak declared as 1st Sultan of founded Sultanate. Earlier Sultan word was used for most efficient General who sacrifice life for their Master.
The Medieval  history of India is a vast topic which students generally feel difficult to cover and moreover the complete notes for ancient history for IAS exam and other State civil services exam is very less available on internet and students generally feel boredom to cover it from internet. So in this video, I have tried to make the concepts interesting with the help of interesting stories associated with different empires, civilizations and persons. I have used my own personal and class notes so that the students who are not getting IAS or UPSC or PSC coaching from anywhere can take advantage from my videos. I hope the video will benefit to all the students who are preparing for any kind of competitive examination especially UPSC and State Civil services. I hope you will definitely like my video and if does please also SUBSCRIBE to my channel.

To get Ancient and Medieval history ppts (in PDF format) and Punjab related video ppts through pendrive, students can contact @98555-99098 (Harsimranjeet Singh) or email at navneet.bhangu123@gmail.com At the request of many students, ppts would be available at meagre amount. To get Ancient and Medieval history ppts (in PDF format) and Punjab related video ppts through pendrive, students can contact @98555-99098 (Harsimranjeet Singh) or email at navneet.bhangu123@gmail.com The Medieval  history of India is a vast topic which students generally feel difficult to cover and moreover the complete notes for ancient history for IAS exam and other State civil services exam is very less available on internet and students generally feel boredom to cover it from internet. So in this video, I have tried to make the concepts interesting with the help of interesting stories associated with different empires, civilizations and persons. I have used my own personal and class notes so that the students who are not getting IAS or UPSC or PSC coaching from anywhere can take advantage from my videos. I hope the video will benefit to all the students who are preparing for any kind of competitive examination especially UPSC and State Civil services. I hope you will definitely like my video and if does please also SUBSCRIBE to my channel.

The fall of Burma frighten the British and now Japanese army began to knock the doors of India after Burma and Singapore.

The war cabinet of Britain sent Sir Stafford Cripps to India on March 1942 to seek cooperation from the Indians. 

Salient Features

Through the Cripps mission for the first time, British government recognized the “Right of Dominion’ for India. 

Indians were given promise of liberty to frame their own constitution. 

The Cripps mission which was a move to appease the Congress, 
Muslim League and Indian states at the same time was rejected by all of them. 

Gandhi wanted an undivided India, Muslim league wanted a separate Pakistan , Congress demanded a full control over defense “stating that a slave country cannot have any inspiration” . 

Muslim league said there was inadequate representation of Muslims. Sikhs rejected because of non accession of provinces

The Dalits and depressed classed also rejected because there was nothing new for them.",History
301,8EYHx3d5,Kalinga War - Interesting Facts | Indian History Videos for Kids | Mocomi Kids,"https://mocomi.com/ presents:Kalinga War

Kalinga War - Interesting Facts | Indian History Videos for Kids | Mocomi Kids.

The Kalinga war is the most famous war fought between the Mauryan Emperor, Ashoka the Great and the State of Kalinga.
 
Kalinga was a feudal republic state now known as Odisha.

This war was the last battle which Ashoka the Great ever fought. 

Bindusara, the father of Ashoka had made some attempts to conquer Kalinga, but had been defeated.

The war began in 261 BC which was the 8th year of Ashoka's reign. 

The king of Kalinga was Raja Anantha Padmanabhan during this time. 

After Bindusara's death, Ashoka took complete charge to annex Kalinga.

By taking ammunitions to protect their land, the brave and loyal people of Kalinga fought fiercely against the armies of the Mauryan Empire. 

But it turned into an infamous bloodshed battle. 

Around 100,000 Kalinga civilians and more than 10,000 of Ashoka's own warriors died during this battle.

The bloodshed in the war was so much that it is said, the Daya river running next to the battle field turned red with the blood of the slain.
 
Ashoka felt that he was the cause of this destruction which made him devote the rest of his life to Ahimsa (non-violence).  

After the Battle of Kalinga, Ashoka ended his military conquest of expansion of his empire, and he ruled his empire for more than 40 years with peace, harmony and prosperity. He was thus honoured  with the title, Ashoka The Great.

307,6QQBfO16j,Jain Dharm Ka Itihas (History of Jain Dharma) by Sargam Gupta | Indian History | CGPSC e-Gyan,"Jainism is an ancient religion of India. Jains trace their history through twenty-four tirthankara and revere Rishabhanatha as the first Tirthankara (in the present time-cycle). The last two tirthankara, the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha (c. 872 – c. 772 BCE) and the 24th Tirthankara Mahavira (c. 599 – c. 527 BCE)[3] are historical figures. There is limited historical evidence for the 22nd Tirthankara Neminatha who was the cousin of Krishna.Jainism is a philosophy of eternity and Jains consider their religion to be eternal. According to Heinrich Zimmer, Jainism can be traced back as far as third or fourth millennium BC, due to the discovery of a series of great late Stone Age cities in the Indus Valley.

The arrival of Vasco Da Gama, from Portugal, heralded the entry of the European spice traders, changed contemporary Indian history for the last 500 years or so. India before the arrival of the spice traders was a land of small kingdoms, ruled by independent kings and rulers. 
The spice traders soon established trading houses and imposed regulation. The small kings and rulers, with unrest and power struggles within them, were soon influenced to allow the foreigners (British, French, Dutch, Portuguese) more and more power, till slowly, India was under the rule of the British Empire. 
Britain's stronghold in India started with the establishment of the East India Company. The colonial strife continued with several revolts across India from 1857 onwards, to finally end in 1947, with India's freedom from colonial rule, through the tireless efforts of several freedom fighters like, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi.

We hope your preparation for Prelims exam is on right track!!

We are pleased to inform you that we are conducting an Open Discussion on Previous 19 Years’ GS Prelims Papers to help you get a better understanding of the nature of questions that have been asked and may be asked.

The underlying motivation behind conducting this open session is that UPSC previous years' papers are always on the checklist of aspirants, but get pushed down the priority line as the exam approaches.

Following are the highlights of the session:

- Trend and pattern of the nature of questions asked in the static portion of the GS syllabus in Economics, Polity, History, Culture, Environment, and Geography.

- Identification of broad themes/topics from which UPSC is asking most of the questions.

- Insights and coverage of the most important and oft-repeated themes in the last 10 years of UPSC papers.

- Types of distractors used by UPSC; tricks and tips to solve MCQs

- Strategy to cover and revise the syllabus in the remaining days for Prelims 2018.

The tentative schedule for the session is:

30th Apr & 1st May - Economics
2nd & 3rd May- Indian Polity
4th & 5th May - Geography
6th May - Indian History
7th & 8th May - Environment
9th May - Art and Culture

We cordially invite you to the Open Discussion on GS Prelims: 10 Years' Papers' Insights and Strategy at 5 PM, every day from 30th April to 9th May at Vision IAS classroom*, 3rd floor, 8, Rajendra Park, Near Rajendra Place metro station pillar number 154, Pusa Road, New Delhi.
