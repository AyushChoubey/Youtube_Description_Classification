2,zHZVeFa0kdk,First India Train Experience | Delhi to Amritsar - Shatabdi Express AC Chair First Class,"We are leaving Delhi and making our way to the North of India on our very first train experience.

Tour we are on in India with On the Go Tours: 

After checking out of our hotel, we made our way to the New Delhi train station where checked in, placed our luggage and found our seats whilst we slowly drifted away from the chaos of the city.

Honestly our 6 hour train ride was super pleasant - we got served soo much food and drink and were able to watch the sunset towards the end of the ride.

We have now arrived in Amritsar and the first stop is the Golden Temple (also known as Harmandir Sahib) where we learnt more about the Sikh religion and saw the amazing kitchens that feed 60,000-100,000 people a day with volunteers.

Another amazing day in India - there's so many more to come!

Train we caught: Shatabdi Express AC Chair from Delhi to Amristar

3,Rbn0cxbl28M,You Won't Believe This is India... 2!,"Did you know India has the most beautiful white sand beaches, crystal clear water, fascinating sea life, coral, and tropical islands in the world? Don't believe me? Come with me to the stunning Andaman and Nicobar Islands Union Territory of India. This is incredible India!

We started at Kala Pathar beach which is the most beautiful and picturesque beach on Havelock Island. Then we take our scooters to the start of the 1.8km trek point to get to Elephant Beach. Elephant Beach is perfect for snorkelling and getting away from the crowded main beaches.

After swimming, dancing, and snorkelling with the fish on Elephant Beach we grab lunch on the way to Radhanagar Beach - the largest and most popular beach on Havelock Island. Then I tell you one of the reasons why I love India so much, India simply has it all!

Forget Goa, forget any other beach in India; the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have the best beaches I've seen in India so far! Havelock certainly has the best beaches between it and Neil Island. Neil Island is more for relaxing on the beach.

In 2018 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi renamed Havelock Island to Swaraj Dweep, Ross Island to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, and Neil Island to Shaheed Dweep.

21,ZlAHgpHxM0,ISTANBUL: Safe for Female Travel? Affordable for Vegetarians!,"http://bit.ly/subscribeMT & http://www.touristhelpline.com/istanb...
This video is based on the initial days of my trip to Turkey. I stayed in Dongyang Hotel near Sultan Ahmet area in Istanbul for a few days. You will get an idea about the cost of a hotel or hostel in Istanbul in this video. I visited a supermarket called Sok in the Sirkeci area of Istanbul. I have shared the cost of things I bought from there. If you are also a vegetarian budget traveller like me, this part of the video would be helpful for you.  I visited a souvenir shop near Sultan Ahmet called Ottoman Art in Sirkeci, bought some souvenirs from there. Thereafter I met some volunteers who help tourist visiting Istanbul. Watch the interesting conversation with the school girls about India, Bollywood, Amir Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Indian soap operas like Utaran. They revealed some interesting things about their mother and grandmothers in this context ;) I also visited a local mobile sim shop near Sultan Ahmet to find the cheapest mobile networks available in Turkey. Then you'll watch interesting sessions with Turkish & Afghan fruit sellers and at the end, you will see me travelling in Istanbul tram to Kabatas for visiting Taksim Square. There also I met an interesting tour guide who helped me reach Taksim Square and understand a few basics about Turkey.

I've made plenty of these myself while traveling this beautiful country as a foreigner. Since 2015 I’ve been traveling around and currently I’m even based in India. Preparing travel is a crucial element of having a good time in a new country. So I made a video sharing the BIGGEST mistake so you don’t have to make them too.

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video:  and this one: 

Q How do you work together with brands?

38,EAWw930UU3,HOW TO DEAL WITH SELFIES IN INDIA AS A FOREIGNER! - India Travel Tips,"It's no secret that Selfies in India are a big thing and since being in India for the last 6 weeks not only have I noticed that Indian's love a selfie of themselves but they also love a selfie with foreigners, aka a lot of white people!

I knew to expect this when I arrived in India and in some ways it has been better than I thought but in some ways it was been worse!

In this video I go through:
WHY Indians ask foreigners for selfies (although hint, i'm not 100% sure and would love to know more in the comments). 
WHERE they ask for them which is usually in tourist sites like Forts, Palaces and Temples.
WHO asks for them because I thought it would just be men but actually it's women, teenagers and couples asking both foreign men and women.
HOW they ask for them as sometimes they don't even say anything , theyjust hold the camera up and expect one, other times they asking saying 'ma'm selfie?' And sometimes it's a sneaky selfie when you don't even know it's being taken!
Finally WHEN when to say yes and when to say no based on my experience and preference!

I hope this helps travellers to India know what to expect when they come to India and are asked for a selfie, and helps Indian's understand it from a foreigners point of view!

Thank you for watching. If you liked this video, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe!

In this India travel vlog, we go off the beaten track and travel to the beautiful state of Garhwal Uttarakhand. We spent time volunteering in the small village of Laluri located in the foothills of the Himalayas and learnt about the Pahaadi people and their culture. Traveling to Uttrakhand and spending time in the village of Laluri has been the highlight of our India Travels so far. It was amazing to volunteer our time to help this wonderful cause and we also made so lifelong friends as well.  We hope you enjoy this India vlog.....we will miss Uttrakand and Laluri, but we hope one day we will return!

47,SKg2_6I_818,Do Indians Really Poop on the Street? 🚽 THE TRUTH! TOILET REVIEW,"Are Indians really defecating in the open? I got sick of trolls insulting Indians, so I'm going to show you the reality of public toilets in the largest city in India, New Delhi. We'll travel down a street in Delhi which encompasses all of India, and I'll show you the reality of toilets in India, including in the slums. It's not what you think.

A lot of people have really outdated views about India, especially in regards to open defecation and the ""lack of public toilets"" in India. The Swachh Bharat (Clean India) Campaign has made great strides in India since its inception in 2014 with literally tens of millions of toilets built and billions of dollars spent every year on building them.

Support Swachh Bharat. Jai Hind.

AMAZING Indian Street Food TOUR in Punjab, India! Check out  for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! It has some of the Best Street Food in INDIA, it's a TRUE curry HEAVEN! We travel in India for street food, and went on a DEEP Street Food TOUR in Amritsar PUNJAB, to try some of the most AMAZING street food around the world! The Food Ranger (Trevor James) is in India eating Street Food! This truly was an amazing STREET FOOD ADVENTURE in INDIA with AMAZING curry, breakfast, and delicious restaurants with UNIQUE Indian food recipes and Indian dinner!

If you love eating street food around the world and street food in India, or even all over Asia, you will love the street food in Amritsar. You can find street food everywhere, where everyone seems to cook delicious Indian recipes for curry and SPICY dishes all over the street.

► MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): 

►BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): 


► MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: 

In one day, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the PUNJAB style. I didn’t realize until after we finished eating, but we didn’t eat any meat or chicken at all! It was true vegetarian HEAVEN!

We started out the day with an AMAZING Indian breakfast in two different Indian street food restaurants. The first was the famous Amritsar Kulcha. I’m pretty sure you can get this dish in Delhi, but here in Amritsar is the origin of this stuffed baked bread from HEAVEN. It’s stuffed with a spiced potato mix and onions. It’s sprinkled with a masala spice and then put DEEP into the Tandoori oven and baked. It’s served to you on a plate with Chole chickpea curry and onion chutney.

The next AMAZING Breakfast we had on our street food tour was the Poori and Chole with Potato sabzi. A little similar with the chole, but the potato sabzi was nice and sweet and tangy and very UNIQUE!

Afterwards, we took our TUK TUK around town for some more amazing street foods.  We enjoyed a street corner tofu curry served with a pancake and then we went to have a sweet and sour buttermilk lassi.

After this, we went to the LEGENDARY Kesar De Dhaba all vegetarian curry restaurant that uses PURE desi ghee. It was extremely flavourful and just a little spicy. We ordered the VEG thali and it was incredible! The paratha bread was so fluffy and covered in pure desi ghee, absolute HEAVEN! We also ate some dessert, a fruit kulfi ice cream!

After this we went for a couple more street foods in Amritsar. We were exploring the back lanes and found an amazing mango fruit stall! It was dried and covered in a slightly spicy and sour and tangy sauce. There were a lot of flavours in this Indian recipe. It was spicy, sour, tangy, sweet, peppery, acidic, pungent, and made your mouth pucker when you ate it! Very UNIQUE!

After this, we went for our final street food, an ICONIC street food in India, the samosa. It was stuffed with potato, cumin seeds, and spices.

The addresses for these street food restaurants in Amritsar, India, are listed below:

1) Breakfast Street Food Kulcha at Monu Kulcha Hut
Gali No, 10, Loharka Road, Ranjit Vihar, N.R.I. Colony, NRI Colony, Gumtala, Amritsar, Punjab 143001, India
2) Amazing Poori and Chole and desserts at Kanha Sweets
Shop 1, Opposite Bijli Pehalwan Mandir, Lawrence Road, White Avenue, Amritsar
3) Fairly OK veg curry DEEP in the back lanes of Amritsar (honestly can’t remember this address, go for the Kesar De Dhaba instead).
4) Delicious Street Lassi at Ahuja Lassi
Near Hindu College, Amritsar, India
5) BEST Vegetarian Curry in the WORLD @ Kesar De Dhaba, Amritsar
6) Amazing Mango sour and spicy dessert at Aam Papad:
Ram lubhaya and sons
7) Potato Samosa at Raam samosey wala

55,7p6f8IYflu4,MY POSITIVE & HONEST SOLO FEMALE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE IN INDIA!,"I have seen many negative videos about solo female travel in India and travel in India in general however I had such a great time in India after spending 4 months in India for the first time so I wanted to make this video to share my positive experience in a very honest way.

I cover the aspect of the the attention solo female travellers get in India, the topic of unsafety in terms of theft, death, violence and rape and the harassment aspect.

I've been honest, it's not all easy, you do get looked at and men will want to speak to you, but I have not felt unsafe in any way in India as a female traveller. There have been times when I've been annoyed and times where perhaps I could have gotten into a bad situation but as I say in this video, I do not speak to strange local men, I do not take their number, I do not go out with them and this means that I do not put myself in any potentially bad situations.

I have never felt like my belongings would be stolen or that I would be mugged or harmed in anyway. Plus I have had many very nice experiences with the people of India especially families.

ABOUT:

Travel has changed my life and I have no plans on stopping any time soon.

That's why I am now running this video blog showing you how to travel the world continuously

FAQ:

How did you learn to edit?
I taught myself. I downloaded Premiere Pro and began to figure out how to use it through trial and error. My videos were pretty bad at first but eventually, and with the help of many tutorials, you start to figure out what works. 

Premiere Pro Link: 

What work are you doing?
I started off running this video blog while doing freelance web design and video editing to supplement my travelling lifestyle. I now rely solely on this blog to generate revenue through advertising, affiliate links and sponsorship opportunities. 

How do you meet the people in your videos?
Hostels, guesthouses and conversations! You meet people so easily while travelling. Just open yourself up and you will meet all sorts of amazing people.
'
Where do you live?
Right now, I travel the world continuously and so do not have a permanent base or home anywhere. I am not sure how long this is going to be the situation but right now I just want to keep travelling.

This is first video from my Point of view Sikkim Series. In this video, I take you through the beautiful landscapes coming on my way from Bagdogra to Gangtok.
This series is about my recent trip to Sikkim. It was a week long trip and I had covered Gangtok, Lachen, Shri Gurudongmar Lake, Lachung, Katao Valley and Yumthang Valley. I will be covering all the mentioned places in a 4 part series. 

Sikkim : Sikkim is a state in northeast India, bordered by Bhutan, Tibet and Nepal. Part of the Himalayas, the area has a dramatic landscape that includes India’s highest mountain, 8,586m Kangchenjunga. Sikkim is also home to glaciers, alpine meadows and thousands of varieties of wildflowers. Steep paths lead to hilltop Buddhist monasteries such as Pemayangtse, which dates to the early 1700s.

Point Of view : This is a web series where I will try to cover different places in India and express my views about the place followed up with suggestions and recommendations and the view of the places from my camera :)

Delhi, India is a true CURRY HEAVEN, and we traveled here to go for this DEEP Street Food tour of Old Delhi! The Food Ranger (Trevor James) is in India eating Street Food! This walk through Old delhi truly was an AMAZING STREET FOOD ADVENTURE with delicious curry, amazing restaurants, and with so much tasty and UNIQUE Indian food recipes for our huge Indian dinner. 

If you love eating street food around the world and street food in India, or even all over Asia, you will love the street food in Old Delhi. You can find street food everywhere, where everyone seems to cook delicious Indian recipes for curry and SPICY dishes all over the street.

In one day in old Delhi, India, we had 7 delicious street foods all made in the halal style. 

We started out the day with an AMAZING ramadan experience at the largest Mosque in Delhi, Jama Masjid. We picked up a ton of different Indian street foods to bring to the mosque and break the fast with all the locals. We shared the delicious food, and then went back to the streets of Old Delhi to try more food. 

The first food we had on our street food tour was the Delhi Fried Chicken, DFC, covered in Indian spices like masala and mustard. It was extremely JUICY and PLUMP!!! 

Afterwards, we tried more BBQ chicken and then went for a nice Indian dinner cooked by one of the locals in Old Delhi. His family recipes were passed down to him and his food was legendary! We ate Indian Chicken Biryani and chicken korma curry along with Buffalo Korma along with Kameeri Roti! It was absolutely delicious! 

After this, we went to the LEGENDARY Changezi chicken joint that invented the recipe for this juicy and flavour packed chicken curry dish! 

To finish of the day, we went for some delicious BBQ Seekh Kebabs, extremely flavourful!!


The addresses for these street food restaurants in Old Delhi, India, are found on the main street below Jama Masjid, Old Delhi, India.

74,-GhY8yZH0,"First Impressions of JORHAT - The Tea Capital of INDIA | Upper Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ► http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ► http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

After I spent two weeks exploring northeast India, I’m convinced that you haven’t truly experienced India until you’ve visited this part of the country. It is so diverse and so different from other parts of the country. My mind was blown at nearly every turn. Between its fascinating history, beautiful cultural sites, pristine national parks, and tasty and unique food, I was in heaven there!

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite 

After spending two unforgettable days in Kaziranga National Park, I began the journey to my next destination, the city of Jorhat in Upper Assam. The cuisine and culture there are very different. 

I made the trip with my friend Honey, who told me a little about the area on the way. I have to thank my friends at the Wild Grass Resort for making my stay in the park so memorable. They really showed me a wonderful time. You should look them up when you plan your trip to Kaziranga National Park!

The trip to Jorhat takes roughly 2 hours. Some of the souvenirs you can get in the park include rhinos carved out of teak. It’s amazing to watch the craftsmen do their work. It’s so precise and they’re of a super high quality. They’re a little more expensive than the ones in the park at 250 rupees, or about $3.60 U.S. But they’re worth it, especially when you’re supporting the locals.

The souvenir stand also sold carved flamingoes and elephants. We continued on to Jorhat along a bumpy road. An hour and a half later, I woke up from a nap. We were just outside of Jorhat. It’s a small town, a little bigger than Tezpur. Every building was one or two stories. I saw lots of roadside vendors and local restaurants. It was definitely similar to Tezpur.

We arrived at the JK Palace, my accommodations. My room was large and super nice. I had a large counter and a TV, an OK view of outside, and a large bathroom. From there, I hit the road with my local friend Rishi and rode around Jorhat on the back of his bike!

It was a little chilly because night had fallen, but I couldn’t wait to explore the city. We got some chai and kachori. The kachori was nice and flaky with lots of layers. There was eggplant inside and it was super delicious. Next was the piping hot chai. It was really frothy and reminded me of café con leche. 

Traveling by scooter is the best way to get around these cities. In a car, you’ll be stuck in traffic forever, but the scooter can squeeze through the gaps. It turns out Jorhat is quite a bit bigger than Tezpur and is much busier. There’s lots of cars, people, and pollution. It’s the second-largest city in northeast India!

Then we went to get a beer at a bar in a hotel. The bar was nice and dark. I ordered a Kingfisher Strong, which was like a mix between a brown ale and a red ale. There were also some chickpeas with green chilies. They were super strong, crunchy, refreshing, and spicy. It was my new favorite snack in India, even though the spice hit me hard later!

If you loved this travel vlog of me documenting my first impressions of Jorhat, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment below.

75,FGe3KhkNx,"Mouthwatering INDIAN STREET FOOD Breakfast Tour - Puri, Sabji & Raj Kachori | Jorhat, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ► http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ► http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn’t wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They’re so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi’s scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn’t have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn’t a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn’t small, but at the same time, it wasn’t huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I’d never had it before. It’s a big, crunchy kachori that’s stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It’s an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn’t contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn’t wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it’s a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don’t miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

88,z7q7PTk,Travel to UDAIPUR Rajasthan India,"You can download this Native Travellers music track here: https://nativetravellers.bandcamp.com...

Travel to UDAIPUR Rajasthan India

In this India Travel Vlog, us two kiwis explore India's most Romantic City, Udaipur. We loved travelling around Udaipur, otherwise known as 'City of Lakes' 'The White City' or the ""Venice of India.' Udaipur is located in southernmost part of Rajasthan state and is set around a series of artificial lakes and is known for its lavish royal residences. As Kiwi's travelling through India, we were shocked but pleasantly surprised to find a few Indian people in Udaipur who could speak a few words of New Zealand's Native Langauge Te Reo Maori. It wasn't hard to find things to do in Udaipur,  we were blown away by the beauty of the lakes and had fun discovering local markets, parks, Rajasthani cultural dance and Rajasthani food!

89,Siw4ehlUMsE,Celebrating Holi in india Rishikesh Haridwar 2018|Travel blog|| Documentary India .,"Holi, the festival of color and love, also signifies the arrival of the spring season, and is held in the month of March, the day after the full moon. The festival begins with the lighting of the Holika bonfire the night before, which represents the victory of good over evil. There are many legends associated with this festival, one of the more prominent ones being of demon King Hiranyakashyap .



If you are in Rishikesh at this time, you will come to the realization that the Holi fever has spread far and wide and there are people, many people who come specially to India to experience the same, with Rishikesh being one of the sought after destinations. Also, the 15th Annual International Yoga festival, organized by the Parmarth Niketan Ashram was on at the same time which draws in a huge crowd. There is a general air of merriment and excitement as you walk the narrow lanes of this town. The night before, the “Holika” is burnt at Laxman Jhula chowk (main crossing), which signifies the start of Holi. People gather around the fire, sing and wish each other. On the day of Holi, the Laxman Jhula chowk becomes the venue for a very public party, crowds gather, both locals and otherwise, there is popular Bollywood music blaring from loudspeakers, everyone is smearing everyone else with colors and wishing each other, and the atmosphere is very fun and festive

Jetlagged. Had free breakfast on the rooftop. Then went back to  sleep and woke up at 4pm. Went to enjoy the last bit of sunlight before I had to go to 'women prison' in my room. (Its not safe for girls to go out after dark according to everyone and their mom). 

It's Election Day so mostly everything was closed, including metros and transportation...so I explored as much as I could on foot without having to worry about getting lost. :)

Here's what I captured in that 20ish minute walk...didn't film walking through a cricket game and New Delhi station, but this was exciting enough I think.",travel

PLEASE NOTE: I despise email in general. If you want to say hi or give me recommendations please leave a comment on a video or on my other social media. I LOVE responding to public comments!

Travel Vlog Iv is a travel and food video channel. I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. 

I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: 

FAQ's:

Q Where are you from?
A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: 

Q How can you afford to travel so much?
A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video:   and this one:  to learn more about my story.

Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?
A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro X

Q (Why) Are you vegetarian?
A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)

Q Why do you usually travel alone?
A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.

Q Why do you love India so much?
A Watch this video:  and this one: ",travel

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

129,qBwCp45nUuE,First Thoughts on India | Exploring the Streets of Old Delhi,"We are heading out to explore the street of Delhi by bike riding through the chaos that is this city...this is our first thoughts on India!

Tour we are on in India with On the Go Tours: 

We woke up super early in the morning to make our way towards Old Delhi. There we begun our exploring by jumping on some bikes and cycling through the back streets. 

Our first stop was down an alleyway near Jama Masjid where we saw how a local bakery was making over 30,000 pieces of bread for the breakfast rush.

Next up we went to the Spice Markets where we got the best view of the city as the sun slowly rose in front of us. We had our Chai and watched the city wake up.

Next up we went to the Gurdwara Bangla Sahib temple to learn more about the sikh's and to volunteer in the sikh kitchen.

We ended our day with an Indian style breakfast.

Where we get our incredible music from:    (--- Great music for Travel Vlogs & YouTube music for your videos)

132,gbD6CWL8eIY,What is Train Travel like in Russia? | Overnight Train to Moscow in 2nd Class,"We are leaving Novgorod and catching the overnight train towards Moscow - this is what overnight train travel is like in Russia.

After presenting our passports and checking into our 4 birth cabin, we settled in for the night on our train. To be honest it was a little smaller than some trains we have caught in the past but we had a comfortable sleep anyways...besides the 5am wake up call!

After arriving in Moscow for Jess birthday she decided that she wanted to go inside a Russian bunker...so we went to the Cold War Museum aka Bunker 42 where went 68 meters below ground and learnt more about this soviet bunker.

To celebrate her birthday we went out to have dinner (and a Moscow mule) at Razvedka (Разведка).

133,gz8E7L2RB,DELHI TO BALI (Indonesia): Advantages of Malaysia Airlines? How I got Bali Visa?,"SUBSCRIBE - http://bit.ly/subscribeMT  

This is the first video of the Bali series. I travelled from Delhi to Bali with Malaysia Airlines. I enjoyed the in-flight entertainment, comfortable reclining seats and relished the vegetarian food. Although it would be better if the flagship carrier of Malaysia can offer more variety of food for vegetarians. After reaching Bali, the first target was to get the Visa on arrival. Bali offers free Visa-on-Arrival for Indian citizens.

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you in DEEP for a FULL ON street food tour of Peshawar, Pakistan. Peshawar is one of the oldest market towns in the world and has one of the richest street food scenes you'll ever witness! You need to travel to Pakistan!

We're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING BBQ Nisar Charsi Tikka Kababs, some amazing UNSEEN Pakistani Pulao, and ULTRA RARE PIZZA NAAN!!

You will fall in  love with the street food in Peshawar as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting out with an UNSEEN Pulao, found in downtown Peshawar in the old area where there is street food everywhere! Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with unbelievably delicious bone marrow!

After this, we're going Foodrangin' and finding some local street stalls before going to Nisar Charsi Tikka BBQ Mutton HEAVEN!

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

157,ChFrZf-Bf50,Ethiopia Travel Guide + Vlog | Addis Ababa and Awassa,"What are the best things to do in Ethiopia? This travel guide slash vlog will show you everything I did during my two weeks there! From Addis Ababa to Awassa, I'll take you to two beautiful regions of the country and share some of my best travel tips.

I visited Ethiopia for work, so didn't get to do many typical touristy things like the churches in Lalibela, Danakil Depression or hiking the Simien Mountains. But my experiences were perhaps a little more local and authentic than your average guided tour, so I hope you'll take this video for what it is. 

Have you ever been to Ethiopia? Did you just pass through the capital of Addis Ababa, or did you have time to go sightseeing? Let me know in a comment below, I'm so curious!

Our travel and food in sikkim was fun, had great time in Gangtok...If you have any experience of Gangtok in terms of sightseeing or food, do share that in comments below…

Travelling cost:  Refer to EP 1 description section on how below cost is calculated.

Min cost to reach Gangtok: Rs 500.
Hotel: Rs 1500 per day.
Food Rs 500 one meal
Total cost of Day 0: Rs 2500

Day1 : Cab for local sightseeing  for 8 hours Rs 2500.
You may want to take share cab for point to point travelling but then you can't travel to all tourist destinations. 

Example from MG marg you can take a share cab for trolley point by paying Rs 20.. but you can't go to Hanuman Tok on share cab as on that route no share cab.,

OLA and uber taxi service not available.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 : 
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.

173,6BoYfs2I0r8,How I make money while traveling the world (and eating),"►How to Start a Travel Blog: https://migrationology.com/how-to-sta...
►How to Make Money While Traveling: 

The number one question I get asked is how I can afford to travel, while making money, and blogging. I'm going to answer how I make money, and also how I can afford to travel and eat in this video. Also, I'll share how I think you can do it too!

There are many many ways to make money while traveling, and I have friends that are working on cruise ships, blogging, affiliate marketing, freelance writing, and even skydiving, while earning money to be able to maintain a lifestyle traveling. But instead of sharing all the ways on how to make money traveling, I'll first share the ways I make money.

First I want to say that all of these ways that I make money while traveling are all the result of initially starting a blog back in 2009 and committing to writing quality and useful information on it on a regular basis. 

If you want to make money while traveling, I'd highly recommend you start a blog on whatever you're passionate about and begin blogging high quality useful information to show your expertise, and also connecting with others. (If you're just starting a travel blog, Travel Blog Success is an excellent course that I recommend:  [affiliate])

1. Affiliate recommendations - This basically means earning a small commission as a referral. There are many companies (places like Amazon and Agoda.com for hotels) that offer a commission if you refer someone to a purchase. As an example, on my website I give away a lot of free useful tips about visiting Bangkok (). And I also recommend a few hotels which, some of which I've previously stayed at, and others which I've just visit and highly recommend. So if you were to click one of the links and book that hotel, I would get a small commission as a referral. I only recommend things that I use myself or trust.
2. My premium travel and food guides - The biggest way I make money while traveling is by selling my premium travel and food guides (). Right now I have the Bangkok 101 things to do guide, Eating Thai Food Guide, Vegetarian Thai Food Guide, and the Delhi travel guide, and I'm working on more. I prefer to sell my own guides than doing advertising on my website, because I can trust in the quality of my own guides.
3. Freelance writing - As a result of first starting my travel blog back in 2009, I've had the opportunity to do numerous freelance writing projects, some big and some small. I've written for a few inflight magazines, as well as CNN Travel, and various other newspapers, magazines, and websites. I used to dislike writing, but the more I started blogging about thing I really enjoyed (like food) the more I enjoyed it. And after committing to it and blogging, I've been able to connect with so many others and had chances to write for many places. A blog is a great way for you to have a public profile of your expertise.
4. Video, YouTube - Finally, the fourth way of how I make money while traveling and blogging is through videos. I made the decision to start making videos and I have committed to it. Ads on some of my videos is another chunk of my monthly income.

Along with how to make money while traveling and blogging, it's also important to say how I can afford to travel? Most of the money my wife and I make now goes back into our traveling and eating. However, it's all about your priorities. We don't own a car and pay for gas, and instead we choose to buy plane tickets and eat street food. You have to set your own goals and priorities and live intentionally to pursue them.

176,iKJoMO0vJ5,The DIRTIEST Scam in India 💩👞,"A year ago an Indian scammer squirted poo on my shoe! Ever since then I've been trying to capture this scam on camera. I finally did it! The naughty poo-on-shoe scammer, Mr Poo, sneaks up behind unsuspecting tourists in New Delhi and squirts poop on their shoes then offers to clean it off for a crazy amount of money. This time he squirted my friend less than a minute after I warned him this was the area of Delhi that Mr Poo operates. Yeah, I couldn't believe it either! And luckily, whenever I go through this area, I'm always filming to catch scammers.

According to online posts, this scam has been operating around Palika Bazaar since at least 2005. Mr Poo spends his day walking around the outside streets of Palika Bazaar stalking foreign guests to India. He strikes with his poop-shooter when the road isn't so busy or if he has something like a pillar to hide behind. He's cautious not to let too many people see his work.

After he scammed my friend, I kept following him and captured him also attacking a British couple. They had no idea. I watched the entire thing. From him bending down to squirt the poo on the man's shoe to approaching them with the shoe cleaner. Precisely the same thing that happened to my friend and me.

If you want to do something about this, share this video with the Delhi Police. It's their job to stop this guy from pooping on more foreigners shoes!

178,3hGgGGYROG,"Travel Tinder in MY NEW FAVOURITE INDIAN CITY (Aizawl, Mizoram)","I met a stranger off the internet in India, and it turned out to be one of the best days ever. Dino took me all around Aizawl and showed me the city like only a local can! He showed me traditional Mizo villages, Mizo food, and the spectacular natural beauty Mizoram has. I feel in love with Aizawl, and now it's one of my favourite cities alongside New Delhi, Vadodara, and Hampi.

 Traditional Mizo village & headhunters
 Forget Manali!
 All they eat is rice
 Why people in Northeast India look different
 Most beautiful church in India
 Aizawl city
 Guy holding gate for a cat
 Sunset to die for
 Rice beer
 Traditional Mizo food

We visited the top tourist attractions of Aizawl including Falkawn village, Lalsavunga Park, Solomon's Temple (Church), Bara Bazaar, Mizoram State Museum, and got a fantastic sunset view of Aizawl.

Aizawl is the most beautiful, clean, and picturesque hill station I've ever been to in India! I was really blown away by this hard to get to and little-explored city. It's so unexplored in India because the airport is 1.5 hours away from the Aizawl and it's situated in the rugged mountains - so travel is not easy or comfortable in the state.

Aizawl, Mizoram, India, is a difficult place to travel to, but you'll be rewarded with natural beauty, friendly locals, and great food if you dare to venture there.

Did I just invent Travel Tinder? Maybe...

179,_VcD8dVSZ5,Meet the people of Kerala India,"Kerala is the South Western province of India. The people of Kerala speak the Malayalam language. Kerala People are a heterogeneous group of people who have distinctive cultural and religious traditions. During my two weeks visit in Kerala as part of the Kerala Blog Express (www.KeralaBlogExpress.com) I was able to travel through most of Kerala and discover the joys of the Kerala People. Their music, traditions (Kathakali), personalities and laughter.

One of the things I've really enjoyed about India are the people they are so warm and friendly and hospitable and they are always so keen to be on camera.

Let me show you what I mean. Here we go.

Pedro Richardson from www.TravelWithPedro.com “Kerala people they are beautiful and they are extremely pleasant. They're very open to talk to people, to get to know you. They're very curious about us.” 

Zuzanna Chmielewska from www.zuinasia.wordpress.com “Children are amazing. They really don't mind anything and they will be happy to pose and see what's on your photo. But generally in India what I like is that, besides the happiness, they still really stick to the culture.”

We're on the Back Waters and everyone is standing and waving at us. People are so friendly. It's so nice.",travel

Find out exactly what they do with these items you give them and how you can really help people who really need charity in India.

Shot in Mumbai, this auntie and her entire family work the streets every day running this scam. During the scam, an Indian Nun came up to me to help me and stop me being scammed! She was terrific and demonstrates the lengths Indians will go to to help foreign guests in their country. This Nun actually knew the family and told me this women's daughters are being educated by her at a Christian missionary charity called Prem Dan.

Is it possible to eat 1,000 rupees worth of INDIAN STREET FOOD in a single day?!

The food is delicious on the streets, but it's so rich, and often fried. Plus, each dish costs an average of about 30-50 rupees, so it's incredibly difficult to spent that much money in a single day eating exclusively street food, assuming your stomach holds up.

About Me:

My name is Kevin Cook. I'm originally from Dallas, TX, but I've been living and traveling in Asia since 2013.

After graduating from university in 2011 and working a few unfulfilling jobs, I saved enough money to move to Asia and work as a teacher for a few years. That opportunity allowed me to travel around and experience new foods and cultures, and ignited a passion for blogging and making videos.

Now I travel full-time and make videos with the goal that I can encourage YOU to pursue your own dream of overseas traveling and living.

195,-ZU_IoFuwCA,"Trying Top 10 FAMOUS INDIAN STREET FOODS in MUMBAI, INDIA","Behold the Indian Street Food Tour #4 in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Here we got a list of the top 10 BEST street foods in Mumbai, and I must say, the sheer flavor of these foods is simply amazing. I had no idea that Mumbai was home to some of the best eating experiences in India, but once I went on this food tour, I was pleasantly surprised.

This EXTREME taste test started out when my Indian friends met me in downtown Bombay to start this food review out. They were kind enough to come up with a pretty in-depth plan of action, and slowly but surely, they guided me all around the city to some of the best street snack stalls they knew of. What really surprised me was not just the quality of the food, but also the cheap price and the fact that most foods were vegetarian. Usually, I love to eat meat, but I could see how so many Indians can live a vegetarian lifestyle. With food this good, it’s actually quite easy to go meat-free!

Now, after trying Indian food the likes of which I’ve never seen before, it was pretty difficult to choose my favorites. But if I had to choose, I’d say the masala dosa, pav bhaji, vada pav, Bombay sandwich, and frankie were among my top eats. These delectable treats were jam-packed with spices, infused with curry, and doused with chutney. I’m not sure what recipe they used, but I guess that’s part of the beauty of travel in Incredible India. Each delicious bite is like an incredible adventure for your taste buds, and I think it's safe to say that this will not be my last India food tour!

But what do you think? Are there any famous Mumbai foods that I missed in this tour? If so, please let me know down below in the comment section.

► Previous Indian Food Tour: 

The street food list is as follows:
1.  Omelette Pav
2.  Masala Dosa
3.  Mumbai Vada Pav
4.  Chinese Bhel Manchurian
** BREAK FROM EATING:  Sugar Cane Juice
5.  Pav Bhaji
6.  Bombay Sandwich
7.  Sev Puri
8.  Samosa Pav
9.  Mumbai Falooda
10. Mumbai Tibs Frankie
** BREAK FROM EATING:  Masala Chai

204,0n06DQpxSZ,Why I left India... Did I feel safe as a solo female traveler?,"Watch me explain why I left India 3 days into my 1 month solo travels. 

It was my first time travelling to India.

And don't worry, i'm not scared off from India. I just felt unsafe and too overwhelmed on my own.

Hopefully I will be back there soon with someone by my side so I can explore and appreciate India for the beauty I know it has.

Hope you enjoyed this video, and please leave any questions of comments down below.

There were so many delicious curries to choose from, and there was a huge pot of CHICKEN biryani right on the street. The Chicken looked so tender and you could see the steam and all the juices were infused into the basmati rice. You could also smell the cardamom in the biryani!

206,3b-BYAFYZa0,Savaari: Inspiring India to Travel,"~Explore India, one roadtrip at a time~

A road trip is one of the most exhilarating ways to travel the length and breadth of India. When you travel by road, you witness the gentle, imperceptible shift in culture, climate and scenery. You see incredible richness and diversity, but you also see the underlying continuity. You experience the plains slowly giving way to the hills, the hills giving way to the oceans. You see differences in architecture, in the way people dress, talk and eat. 

Because we love travelling by road so much, we've been striving to make sure you have a great experience too. We believe that the time you spend on your vacation should be entirely yours. So why not sit back and take our chauffeur driven cabs on your next trip? We are now in 98 cities across India – you dream the place, we take you there.

Travel begins with Savaari.

208,SijX3FuAQ4,India to Canada flying with British Airways travel vlog (Kolkata - Mumbai - London - Toronto),"Just for our last day in India as we leave from India to Canada from Kolkata to Toronto via Mumbai and London with British Airways in this travel vlog. Having been on the road for 9 consecutive months we decided to end our travels in Asia a bit early (originally we had allotted time for travel in Japan, Vietnam, China, Indonesia and the Philippines) after feeling a little worn out and homesick. Audrey's parents got a new pet (a German Shepherd puppy) recently and we excited to meet him (Togo). This was one heck of a marathon trip as we connected through four major cities with plenty of waiting time in between each connecting flight. You'll notice we were absolute pigs in this video eating every chance we got and probably consuming double or triple the amount of calories we'd normally have in a similar time period. LOL, what can I say other than food kept us partially sane during for such a long trip.

India to Canada flying with British Airways travel vlog (Kolkata - Mumbai - London - Toronto) travel video transcript:

Well I think you can guess where we are. Back at the airport. Back at the airport. So yeah, this is it for us in India. We have got a lot flights ahead of us. Why don't you tell us about those.

Well okay. Haha.

So initially we were thinking of traveling around Asia a little bit longer. Yeah. But honestly it has been like seven or eight months. No, it has been longer. It has been closer to nine I think. Yeah.

Anyways, it has been a long time and we're feeling a little bit tired. We're missing family, we also want to visit our pets. So we're heading back to Canada. Yeah, and there is a new addition to Audrey's family.

Yeah, so we have a German Shepherd. It is kind of sad but my two cats and my dog past away in the last year. In the last few months. Yeah.

So we'll be meeting my German Shepard Togo. My pup brother. Togo. I already call him Wolfie. He looks like a little wolf. Yeah, he is really cute. We can't wait to meet him for the 1st time.

So first things first we're at the Food Boulevard inside the airport and we're going to go get some food because we didn't have a very big breakfast. And I'm hungry and Sam is hungry and the food looks good here.

Sam was kind enough to go get me food and I'm having some stir-fried noodles with vegetables. What you got looks really good as well.

I know. What did you get?

Haha.

Sneak peak over here. I got cheese dosa and one of my favorite Indian desserts - Jalebi.

So and that is not all. You went to another little stand for Momos.

Status update. We're going to our gate and we should be boarding in an hour and then we'll be in Mumbai.

So I don't even remember when I was last in India. It was probably like six, seven or eight years ago but I do remember that Mumbai Airport did not look like this. Like it is swanky. They've redecorated and renovated and it is really pretty.

Heading over to the T Dot. Last leg. Final. Three of three. Almost there.

Oh my goodness we are here. We are out. We arrived in Toronto probably like two hours ago bu we had to sit on the plane because someone was sick and paramedics had to come on and then the immigration line was really long. We're here. There is Sam. My sister picked me up. We're on our way home and we're going to meet my dog. Well not my dog. My Dad's dog. My family dog. Ahh. Togo. Anyways it has been a very long video. Three flights over the course of like two days. So we're going to say goodbye. Goodbye everyone. Now it is time to meet Wolfie. Wolfie that is my name. Hahaha. That is not his name. It is Togo. Haha bye.

Say hi Togo. Hello to the world. I'm a cute puppy. Look this way Togo. Hi. Hello. I'm a cute puppy.

Togo. Togo are you being camera shy all of a sudden. Venica. Togo. Oh Togo.

213,G8EKxhoRXR,Delhi City Guide | India Travel Video,"Come join us as we visit Delhi in this city guide to one of the biggest and most important cities in all of India. Our travel video covers some of the main attractions in Delhi (दिल्ली ਿਦੱਲੀ) including the following places:

Things to do in Delhi Travel Guide:

1) Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ)
2) Humayun's tomb (हुमायूँ का मकबरा - آرامگاه همایون)
3) Lodhi Gardens (लोधी बाग़ - لودھی باغ)
4) Jama Masjid (जामा मस्जिद - جامع مسجد)

Our Delhi Travel Guide is a bit of a different format from usual in the sense it is more casual and vlog style; however, we feel as though you'll have a really good idea of things to do in Delhi during your visit especially in Old Delhi (पुरानी दिल्ली). 

GEAR WE USE

Our visit Delhi travel guide documentary covers some of the top attractions including a food guide (best restaurants and street food), top museums, fascinating temples and the city by day and evening when Delhi comes alive at night. We also cover off-the-beaten-path activities you won't find in a typical Old Delhi tourism brochure, Delhi city tour or Delhi itinerary.

Delhi City Guide | India Travel Video Transcript:

Well good morning from Delhi. It is our first day of sightseeing. Sam's parents arrived last night. Yeah. We've got the full group for travels. The squad is ready. We're going to be doing. We're going to be in Delhi for a couple of days. 

Yeah, just a that is how we're kicking things off. And yeah we just started by walking around today. We're visiting the Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ) right now.

All over India. Yeah, so right now we're visiting the Red Fort (लाल क़िला - لال قلعہ) and honestly this is probably going to be a bit of a different format because we obviously want to spend time with Sam's parents. I don't think we're going to be filming as much but we're going to show you some of the highlights and kind of see how it works out. So let's go tour Delhi now. 

After wandering around the Red Fort for an hour or so, it was time for a little break, so we decided to introduce my parents to their first cup of masala chai in India. 

From there we went on a short tour of Old Delhi during rush hour, which in retrospect may not have been the best idea. It was a little too crowded to walk, so we popped into a restaurant for lunch instead. 

After visiting Humayun’s Tomb, we took two cycle rickshaws over to the Lodi Gardens. It was getting close to lunch hour, so first we stopped at “Lodi - The Garden Restaurant” where we had a really nice meal in an outdoor setting. From there we were just a few steps away from the actual gardens, which proved to be a popular spot on the weekend. 

The Gardens are named after the Lodhi Dynasty, who ruled parts of northern India from the mid 15th century to the early 16th century, before the rise of the Mughal Empire. The gardens contain various tombs and mosques, and it’s a very tranquil setting in what can otherwise be a very chaotic city. 

Like most structures in Old Delhi, Jama Masjid is made of red sandstone and white marble, and it also happens to be one of the largest mosques in all of India.

So we're at the train station here in Delhi (दिल्ली ਿਦੱਲੀ) and that means we are wrapping up the trip here. What an adventure. So yeah that is it for our time in Delhi. That was an assault on the senses. Oh yes. Delhi is a very chaotic but yet exciting city and there is a lot to do but it is the kind of place where once you've seen a few attractions and you're ready to move on yeah. Yeah, it is time to move on. And we are moving on. Where are we off to next? We're off to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. So this is somewhere I've been before. I'm so excited to be going there. So stay tuned for those adventures. We've got a lot more destinations in India to come. Bye!

224,DyzbYGYyNvY,SPICEJET REVIEW - Flying from Varanasi to Goa! | India Travel Day Vlog,"My first internal flight within India was from Varanasi to Goa with SpiceJet. I flew from Varanasi to Hyderabad and Hyderabad to Goa. 

SpiceJet started off on a bad note as they changed my flight a week before departure from 9:30am to 11:30am from Varanasi which meant I got into Goa 2 hours later than I had booked.

I was worried about flight delays as I had heard a lot of internal flights in India get delayed but thankfully both of my flights were very prompt and on time. Both planes were good, especially the second plane to Goa, it seemed very new. SpiceJet's staff were friendly and Hyderabad was a great airport to connect in.

All in all, a really good travel day in India! I would fly with SpiceJet again!
