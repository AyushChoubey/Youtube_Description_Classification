Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours:  for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn’t eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there’s a version that’s comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. 

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I’ve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ½ chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven’t already, watch the full series here:

Boiling some rice, adding a little chicken fillet and putting some fennel and other seasoning in that soup has become a pot of warm stomach porridge.

4,UvDGBIkJaqQ,"Chinese Street Food DAN DAN NOODLE Tour in Sichuan, China | INSANELY GOOD and SPICY Szechuan Noodles","One of the best Chinese street foods you will ever eat in China is the Dan Dan Noodles! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! Spicy Chinese Dan Dan noodles are the best street food in China! If you love spicy Sichuan food and street food in China, then you're going to love Dan Dan noodles, because they are so flavorful and covered in a rich chili oil!

In this Chinese street food video, we're bringing you on a full on Dan Dan noodle tour of Chengdu, China, DEEP in the heart of Sichuan in Southwest China. This is the land of delicious and spicy Sichuan cuisine, sometimes spelled Szechuan cuisine. There are so many famous Sichuan foods to try here in Chengdu, but today, we are trying 4 different variations of Dan Dan noodles, also sometimes called Zajiang noodles. 

► MUSIC I USE (Great For YouTubers): 

►BEST VPN FOR CHINA (ACCESS YOUTUBE): 


► MERCH AVAILABLE HERE: 

China has so many amazing street foods to try, and I've been filming and documenting them for you for the past 4 years. In my opinion, the best noodle dish in China is dan dan noodles, right here in Chengdu, Sichuan. China has some of the best street food around the world, and these dan dan noodles were INSANELY GOOD, some of the best noodles in China for sure!

If you're traveling to China to eat and try different street foods, and perhaps want to learn a little bit about Chinese food and chinese cooking in the process, you need to try a few different variations of Dan Dan noodles. When they prepare the traditional Chinese dan dan noodle recipe right on the street, you can watch as they scoop the main ingredients like chili oil, soy sauce, sichuan peppercorn, and garlic right into the noodle bowl and then place the steaming hot noodles right over top. It's truly satisfying! After they put the noodles over top, they place their signature fried ground pork on top, known in Chinese as shaozi. 

When your dan dan noodles arrive to your table, it is very important to mix up all the chili oil and all of the ingredients throughout. This ensures that the flavour and the hot oil gets coated onto each noodle before you take a bite. It's also quite satisfying mixing the noodles and watching the dark red oil slowly turn each noodle from white into red and silky smooth. 

When you take your first bite, you'll understand why this is one of the BEST Chinese street foods you need to try. The spicy noodles are coated with an incredibly aromatic chili oil and really send you straight up to heaven! It's one of the best forms of Chinese cooking!

►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: 
►T-shirts available now: 

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour (it’s not sponsored), but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

Luxi who was our guide also has a cooking school called Rice and Friends () - we’ll visit her cooking school on Day 3 of this series.

Ok, now onto the info about this Chinese street food tour in Yunnan:

Xizhou, China

On Day 1, we drove from Dali Old Town to Xizhou, another ancient town near Dali, that’s known for some famous Chinese street food snacks.

We started for breakfast with a thick pea porridge and a pea pudding salad. The grandmother serving had been making these same dishes since she was a child with her mother. The breakfast was warming and delicious, and it hit the spot in the morning.
Total price - 8 RMB ($1.20)

Xizhou Baba - Probably the most famous Chinese street food you have to try in Xizhou is baba, which is also sometimes known as a Chinese pizza. It’s a round of dough that’s mixed with lard and meat, or the sweet version, and baked in a unique street oven using charcoal. Part of the fun is watching it being made. Then of course, eating it is absolutely delicious.
Price - 10 RMB ($1.50) per piece

Yunnanese cheese - Next up in Xizhou we went to watch a local Yunnanese Cheese demonstration. Yunnan is one of the few places in China where there is a cheese culture - some say it was brought over with the Mongols. We made some local cheese, then put it out to dry, then they let us sample some different types of the prepared cheese. Price - 8 RMB ($1.20)

Yi He Zhuang (怡和庄) Restaurant - This Yunnanese ethnic Bai Chinese food meal was the highlight of my day. We had an absolute feast of a meal, including a few unique Chinese dishes like raw pig sashimi and pine needle salad. Everything was colorful, using natural ingredients and the flavors were spectacular. This meal is one I’ll never forget.
Total price - 215 RMB ($32.41)

Dali Old Town - It was a long day of delicious Chinese food, and in the evening we drove back to Dali Old Town and headed out for dinner.

Duan’s Kitchen - For dinner we were back in Old Town Dali, and my friend Frank from Zouba Tours mentioned that Duan’s Kitchen was a little touristy,  but he said we needed to try it because the food was amazing and they are doing some unique things. The food was outstanding, and my favorite dish was the chicken braised in chili oil with pu’er tea.
Total price - 180 RMB ($27.14)

This is Day 1 of our Chinese Food in Yunnan  tour. Thank you for watching, and more food coming!

29,Zz11Y2CAP,"INSANE Chinese Seafood - $1500 Seafood FEAST in Guangzhou, China - 10 KG BIGGEST Lobster + KING Crab","INSANE Chinese Seafood FEAST in Guangzhou! Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! We found the most CRAZY Chinese Seafood in Guangzhou. This Chinese seafood restaurant is like a huge seafood Aquarium!  There is so much EXOTIC Chinese seafood here! This is like upgraded Chinese street food! GIANT Seafood HEAVEN!

If you're wanting to eat seafood in Guangzhou, you can come to Guangzhou HongXing restaurant. It has the most INSANE selection of Chinese seafood from around the world, all picked up daily from the local fish market! They have every type of seafood you can order it in a huge variety of different cooking styles. 

When you walk into hongxing seafood restaurant, you immediately feel like you're walking into a seafood heaven. This is different from our regular Chinese street food videos, this is a  Chinese seafood feast video! And today we are featuring all cantonese style cooking, one of the 8 main specialties of Chinese cuisine! This is less spicy than Sichuan food, this is much more elegant and refined and clear style, very delicious!

When you walk in, you'll see hundreds of different fish tanks full of  seafood!

You'll see at least 2 aisles full of lobster from around the world. Australian lobster, Boston lobster, and more. And you'll also find aisles full of different crabs from around the world. The biggest ones are the Alaskan king prawns. You can order these steamed or boiled and covered in a garlic sauce.  The crab legs are full of flesh! Super tasty! This is Chinese style seafood mukbang! This is way better than a regular seafood boil!

You'll also find rows of different clams, mussels, abalone, oysters, and more exotic things too. There is water beetles, snakes,  and also classic Cantonese stir fry dishes too. You can eat dim sum, fried noodles, and cantonese desserts too!

This is one of the most expensive restaurants in Guangzhou for seafood. In my opinion, if you can afford to spend a little for one crab, it is totally worth it to taste the cantonese style of cooking. 

Chinese seafood restaurant name: 东江鸿星海鲜酒店
Chinese seafood restaurant address: 广州市海珠区侨光路2号东江鸿星海鲜酒店

If you love Chinese food and Chinese cuisine, you're going to love the seafood we found in this video! So much lobster flesh, huge king crab legs, and more! I hope you enjoy this seafood feast video from Guangzhou, China!

Today we're trying Chinese Food. Or rather, we're cooking chinese food for our friend. Today we have two popular Chinese treats that we're cooking for our friend. The first is a really popular chinese snack / chinese street food which is curry fish ball. It's a very popular Hong Kong Food, and was a big part of our upbringing. 

The second is Kung Pao Chicken which is a very popular sichuan food dish. Definitely not exotic asian food by any means, but our friend comes from a small town, and has never really had authentic chinese food. What's available where she's from is like American Chinese Food. But it's not an Americans try Chinese Food - instead she's from Europe! Hopefully she'll enjoy trying these chinese treats today!

Btw we're not experts at cooking chinese food or anything. We're following Chinese Food recipes we found online, so don't expect anything crazy professional. It's a food challenge!

Chinese Food Sichuan - Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
Chinese food gets more interesting the deeper you go. I set off for Chinese street food and cuisine in deep southern Sichuan province by bicycle. I rode my bike down deep into Southern China's lush and mountainous liangshan region, in search of delicious Chinese street food and Chinese food. The Chinese food really was different in this region. The liangshan region is home to Chinese Yi ethnic minority, who have their own cuisine. It was very rural and in some areas also very poor, so I had difficulty finding the yi cuisine at first. Later in the second half of the video, I found a Yi restaurant and had a Chinese food feast! The little village I visited was called Butuo, about 120 km from Xichang.

►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: 
►T-shirts available now: 

Charoen Chai Community (ชุมชนเจริญไชย เยาราช), Bangkok, Thailand.

I’ve known Michael from Bangkok Vanguards () for a number of years, and he’s a great guy. So we met up to hang out, eat, and explore and talk about a little more serious subject - the endangered Charoen Chai Community (ชุมชนเจริญไชย เยาราช) in Bangkok’s Yaowarat, Chinatown.

Before exploring the neighborhood though, we stopped of course to eat some nearby Thai street food.

Jay Eng (ร้านเจ๊เอ็ง) - Kuay teow lawd boran (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวหลอดโบราณ) is what this famous street sells. It’s an ok dish, not my absolute favorite, but it’s not a common dish to find in Bangkok either - this old type of style - it’s well worth trying out. Their fried fish cakes (ทอดมันปลา) are awesome.
Price - 35 THB ($1.07) per plate 

Satay (สะเต๊ะ) - Next just down the road, and it actually has the same owner, we had some pretty fantastic satay. I especially enjoyed the liver.
Total price - 220 THB ($6.74)

Charoen Chai Community (ชุมชนเจริญไชย เยาราช) - What we really came to explore was Bangkok’s Charoen Chai Community (ชุมชนเจริญไชย เยาราช). This community is threatened by development. Now, Michael and I both know how development is a good and necessary part of any city, however it’s also good to preserve amazing living pieces of history. This community is one of the last Thai Chinese communities in Bangkok that has remained almost the same for a hundred years.

Khao Tom Jay Suay (ข้าวต้มเจ๊สวย) - For dinner we headed to one of the best Thai Chinese street food restaurant right across the street from the community - right next to the community. It had been a few years since I’d eaten there and the food was as good as I had remembered.

Asian date mussels (หอยกะพงผัดต้นหอม)
Stink beans with shrimp (ผัดเผ็ดสะตอกุ้ง)
Daylilies with crispy pork (ผัดดอกไม้จีนสดหมูกรอบ)
Silver barb, pickled mustard greens (ปลาตะเพียบต้มเกี่ยมฉ่าย)
Soup with pickled plum (แกงจืดบ๋วยหมูสับ)

Total price - 450 THB ($13.78)

Big thanks to Michael for hanging out and walking around! He offers some very unique and off the beaten path tours of Bangkok which you can check out here:

Longjing Green Tea Shrimp, also known as shrimp stir fry with Dragon Well tea, is a specialty of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province in China, the hometown of Longjing tea (Dragon Well tea).  Infused with the aromatic Longjing tea, this dish pleases with the lingering fragrance of the tea and the crunchy texture of the shrimp.

Tea isn't just appreciated for its good taste and worldwide appeal, it also offers numerous health benefits.

Crispy Lemon Fried Shrimp, Panko Breaded Shrimp with Lemon Sauce recipe, makes a great tasting appetizer or even a meal, and they’re so easy to prepare.

Chef John uses tiger prawns for both recipes and they have a distinctly bold, sweet, firm-textured meat that has earned them the honor of being called the 'poor man's lobster'.

65,8GdYJIanFz4,Spicy Cumin Lamb Noodles at Xi'an Famous Foods & Flushing New York City Chinese Food Tour!,"Xi'an Famous Foods serves amazing food in Flushing, Queens, NYC!
►Subscribe to my channel: 
►Check out my NYC food guide: 
►T-shirts: 

On Day 31 of our Round The World Trip with Star Alliance we decided to take a New York City food tour to Flushing. The main thing I wanted to eat was at the famous Xi'an Famous Foods for their spicy cumin lamb noodles. But we also enjoyed some incredible dumplings and a rack of cumin coated lamb. It was incredible.

 Journey to Flushing, Queens - The first part of the day was to take the train from Manhattan out to Queens, and more specifically to Flushing. It takes a while, but it’s pretty straightforward to get there by public transportation.

 Xi'an Famous Foods - Located in the basement of the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing, Queens, Xi'an Famous Foods is a well known Chinese food restaurant with a number of branches throughout New York City. Xi'an Famous Foods was one of the top places I wanted to eat in NYC. At the bottom of the shopping center there’s a nice food court, and it really does feel like you transport yourself from NYC to China. I ordered the spicy cumin lamb noodles and an extra side of spicy cucumber salad. The spicy cumin lamb, with hand pulled noodles, was absolutely incredible - one of the best food dishes I ate in all of New York. And the spicy cucumber salad also went superbly with the noodles. The chili oil and the cumin was just absolutely superb. Total price - $15.51

 Tianjin Dumpling House - Next up in the same Golden Shopping Mall, I walked over to Tianjin Dumpling House and I ordered their classic pork dumplings. Although you could choose from a range of many different types of dumplings. Overall, they were pretty good and I liked how they were cooked fresh so they were piping hot. Pork dumplings - $5

 White Bear - For won ton lovers in New York City, taking a trip to White Bear in Flushing, Queens, is one of the food lovers pilgrimages. So after the spicy cumin lamb noodles we walked over to white bear. The won tons came with hot chili oil on top and an assortment of mostly pickled mustard greens. Although the chili wasn’t spicy, but was extremely fragrant and tasted amazing. It was another delicious places of dumplings in Flushing. Wonton with hot sauce - $5.50

 Fu Run Restaurant - Finally, our last Chinese food meal in Flushing, we decided to sit down at a restaurant called Fu Run. Along with hot and sour soup and fries string beans, what I really wanted to try at Fu Run Restaurant were the Muslim lamb chops, fried and seasoned with an abundance of garlic and cumin. They were absolutely awesome, fall apart tender lamb, crispy on the edges and just coated in toasted crispy cumin seeds. Although some people say the quality of the Muslim Chinese lamb chops at Fu Run has gone down, I thought they were still absolutely superb. Though I’d like to try the same dish from other restaurants in Flushing, next time I’m in Queens. Total price - $49.50

 Times Square station - Central Park - After coming back from our food trip to Flushing, Queens, we then took a walk around Central Park, just enjoying New York City.

 Fresh&Co - For dinner, since I think I had eaten my share of meat for the day, I decided to go vegetarian and had a salad. Although it was too expensive, it was pretty good. Gaucho salad - $9.95

In China, BBQ Pork and roast pork hog is a common Chinese street food recipe. But what about in rural China? Every year in China, families get together to eat a crispy roast BBQ whole pig hog! This is some of the best Chinese food, better than a lot of street food around the world!

In 2017, I was hoping to eat a whole roast pig, after eating so much street food in China, I was hoping to get some nice homecooked whole pig. Ting Ting invited me out to her hometown for the qingmingjie festival to eat a whole roat pig. The pork belly was the best part, and when wrapped around a sweet flatbread, it was heavenly.

After eating Chinese food throughout a lot of mainland China, I have to say that this whole roast bbq whole pig hog in rural China was one of the best things I've eaten.

74,gekRi5baCLI,Deep-Fried Exploding Egg Wrap ~ The Best Chinese Food You've Never Had,"This is modern day Chengdu street food at its greasiest - and maybe most delicious. Cong you bing, a pancake made with scallion infused batter, is rolled out and then deep fried to a puffy crispiness. Then an egg is cracked and dropped in to the same deep fryer. This is the most exciting part. The egg practically explodes when it hits the oil. They cook it just long enough so the yolk stays runny. After that, the pancake is dressed with a sweet chili sauce, the egg, and whatever topping you want. I chose rou song (pork floss) with seaweed. You can also get a pork cutlet (which is actually what I wanted, but my Chinese character reading isn't good).

Ultimately, this is an amazing snack. It's not healthy by any means, but a crispy texture and the runny yolk, along with the sweet and savory pork floss, make it just plain delicious. 

This place, which is called Exploding Sauce Scallion Pancake in English is also exploding in popularity. There are locations across China. Look them up and head over to try this incredible Chinese snack.

The recipe is below:

RED BRAISED PORK BELLY

1 1/2 lbs. pork belly
6 small pieces ginger
6 cloves garlic
3 + 3 + 1 tablespoons cooking oil
3 cups water
1 tablespoon Chinese cooking wine  (optional)
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 star anise
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 to 2 tablespoons rock sugar
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt

Parboil the pork belly for 10 to 15 minutes to remove the impurities and dirt from the pork belly.  Rinse off the pork belly and cut into  1/2 inch or larger bite size pieces.  

Preheat a wok or pan at medium heat.  Add 3 tablespoons cooking oil.  Then add the ginger and garlic.  Stir fry briefly.  Turn heat to high setting.  Add pork belly pieces.  Add 3 more tablespoons cooking oil.   Sear pork belly on all sides  for a few minutes.  

Put pork belly into a pot.  Add 3 cups water.  Add Chinese cooking wine, dark soy sauce, sesame oil and star anise.  Simmer the pork belly for at least 1 hour at low heat.

Preheat a wok or pan at medium heat.  Add brown sugar and rock sugar.  Use all brown sugar if you can't find any rock sugar.  Stir fry the sugar briefly to melt down a bit.  Add 1 cup of water from the pot where the pork belly was boiling.  

When the sugar is completely dissolved in the liquid, add the pork belly.  Cover with a lid and simmer for 20 minutes to reduce the liquid.  The liquid should turn into a syrup coating the pork belly.  Mix in the light soy sauce and salt.  Serve on a nice plate.  Enjoy!",Food

Chinese food in Southern China and Hong Kong,  Cantonese Cuisine, is world famous for it's elegant flavours and variety. I came to Guangzhou to eat Chinese Food and Cantonese Food. You can find these Chinese Foods throughout Guangdong and Hong Kong. 

Hong Kong food might be a little bit more expensive, but the flavour is the same. I also found Hong Kong Street Food different from Guangzhou street food.  

In China, there are 8 main cuisines, but the one famous Chinese cuisine that is spread throughout the whole world, famous for it's cooking style,  complex recipes, busy seafood restaurants, and delicious street food, is Cantonese food. 

I found the food to be delicious in both Hong Kong and Guangzhou. If you travel to eat like I do, either location will serve you well. You will have a massive selection of both street food and clean and fancy restaurants.

Here are the restaurant addresses, if you are in Guangzhou and want to try those foods out, you can show the address to a taxi driver, or copy and paste it into your google maps app.

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:
 
Amazing Hand Pulled Noodles 兰州七里河北滨河中路2168号 -吾穆勒蓬灰牛肉面

In Guangzhou, China, and Hong Kong, there is some of the best chinese seafood and Chinese street food around the world. In 2016, I began getting more and more serious about eating Chinese street food, and now, in 2017, I'm going full time! Fresh, cheap, and delicious Chinese street food! You have to try it! You can eat and try the best cantonese food specialties like dim sum, bbq roast pork (char sui), rice noodle rolls, and fresh (not cheap) seafood from a local seafood market, all of which are must try chinese foods!

In this food and travel video/vlog, I take you on a full Chinese street food tour of Guangzhou (keep this food in mind if you also visit Hong Kong)- we eat a lot of specialties on the street and in Chinese restaurants together. The addresses for these locations are listed below. Chinese/Asian food recipes are going to be included in my blog shortly.

1) Local street food Chang Fen (rice noodle roll) - These are found throughout the city and are famously eaten during breakfast time in Guangdong, or during yumcha dimsum. I went to a very cheap Chinese restaurant specializing in Changfen in Baiyun district:
Name: 潮汕辉记肠粉 
Address: 广州市白云区岗贝路4号 

2) The best and must try chashaobao AKA charsui bao AKA BBQ pork bun. These beauties are like upgraded baozi steam buns you find all over the streets of China. The pork juicy and covered in a sweet Barbeque sauce and the bun is so fluffy, you won't be able to get enough of them! 
Name: 天天包点 
Address: 广州市越秀区起义路72号

3) Famous Chinese street food Chashao BBQ pork and Shao'e roast goose. These are the best and two must try street foods in China, especially during lunch hour in Guangzhou or Hong Kong
Name: 九爷鸡
Address: 广州市越秀区文明路103号

4) Dim sum at the famous yumcha dim sum restaurant Dim Dou Dak. This is a chain restaurant that serves some of the best cantonese dim sum in the city. Be sure to order the shao mai dumplings, har gao dumplings, fengzhua chicken feet, and their specialty red rice roll. So good!
Name: 点都德
Address: 广州市越秀区越秀中路60号宝贝城4楼

5) The largest wholesale seafood market in Guangzhou. There is a huge selection of seafood here, you could spend a whole day here just watching and discovering all the different types of fresh seafood. It's not cheap unfortunately, it's quite expensive! Be ready to bargain a little bit.
Name: 盛港湾酒楼
Address: 广州市海珠区黄沙海产批发市场

If you have a whole day in Guangzhou or even Hong Kong (you can find exactly the same street foods) to travel and eat and try Chinese street food, then visit some of these amazing and best street food locations! Please leave me a comment down below if you did and let me know how the food was!

108,MUy8Xf3_AtA,Chinese Street Food HOT POT HEAVEN + RABBIT Noodles and SPICY Dumplings in China - CHILI OIL 4 LIFE!,"Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! Chinese Street Food in Chengdu, China is the BEST in the WORLD! 
► BRAND NEW Chili Oil 4 Life Merch here:  

In this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're bringing you to eat at 4 classic Chengdu foods. Chinese cooking is some of the best in the world, and in Chengdu, China, the cuisine is world famously known as Sichuan cuisine or Szechuan cuisine. It is spicy and numbing and covered in delicious Chili oil. I moved here to Chengdu specifically to be able to eat spicy and delicious Chinese street foods. 

►For addresses a full Chengdu Food Tour, visit my blog post on Chengdu street food, it has a huge list of the best street foods to try in Chengdu, China. The Chengdu food guide features all of the locations within this Chinese street food video: ►

In this Chinese street food tour video, we're starting out with one of China's most famous foods; DUMPLINGS. In Chengdu, they are different from the rest of China. Here, they are boiled and covered in a thick and spicy chili oil that leaves you so SATISFIED! These are some of the most satisfying dumplings ever! I must admit though, the filling could have been more plump. If you are traveling to Chengdu to eat Szechuan cuisine, I would personally recommend trying the red chili oil wontons first. 

And after those amazing dumplings in Chengdu, we're eating another famous dish in Sichuan cuisine, RABBIT. Eating rabbit is very famous in Sichuan, and here in Chengdu, locals love it in a numbing and spicy Szechuan Sauce. But we wanted to try a more UNIQUE style of eating rabbit in Sichuan, on top of noodles. So we visited a local rabbit noodle joint and ate a couple unique bowls of Chinese Sichuan noodles. The first was the rabbit noodles, where the rabbit is served to you in thin slices covered in chilies, ginger, and onions. You then pour it over top of your thick and spicy chili oil broth noodle bowl. It was absolutely delicious. The next bowl of spicy noodles that we ordered was the beef noodle soup - red braised beef noodle soup. Super delicious and spicy!

After eating those 2 bowls of delicious Sichuan noodles, we are bringing you to a nice original fly restaurant of Chengdu, Mingting fandian. The fly restaurants of Chengdu are old locations that are sometimes less than cleanly but have incredible food! Nowadays most fly restaurants in Chengdu are actually really clean and you don't have to worry about getting sick from eating the street food. At mingting restaurant, we ordered a river carp,  spicy pork blood, spare ribs, fried sticky rice strips, Sichuan sausages, twice cooked pork, and pig brain tofu. It was all incredibly delicious!

And for our final meal in this Chinese street food tour of Chengdu, China, we're going for one of the most famous foods to try in Sichuan, HOT POT! We found a local 9 section hot pot that serves spicy and delicious hot pot and is always busy! For detailed addresses to these restaurants and street foods, make sure to visit my full Chinese food guide to Chengdu, China:

109,5oQbCOz9nlU,🇨🇳 Food for thought: China's Food Safety | 101 East,"Every year two million people die from unsafe food and water around the world. Food safety experts warn these deaths may be caused by human design, and nowhere is this trend more prevalent than in China.

Tracing the making of a bowl of wonton noodle soup, a 101 East investigation exposes the toxic stew this iconic dish has become.

From tainted additives in noodles, to growth hormones in pork, to industrial filler posing as meat, presenter Steve Chao finds that anything is possible for producers looking to cut corners and make a fast buck.

Do you have a story about Chinese food you consumed?  @AJ101East goes undercover to expose the hidden harm in China's Food Industry.

129,2Ksr0AqieE,Chinese Cooking Rat Meat As Chicken,"This is a gentle reminder for everyone. It is to believe people in China are eating this! These deep fried thingie may look very much like chicken, but take a closer look, you will find the difference!

You will be shocked to find out these are actually RATS!

 Cutting them up into pieces that stimulate chicken parts.

Well seasoned to taste great.
So, think again when you order deep fried chicken. I hope they are not cheating people, instead they are really selling deep fried RAT. But hey, Who is going to eat that??",Food

My wife has never tried Chinese food in America before. I took her to the most average restaurant I could find to try the most popular dishes that the average American orders. 
She bases her rating on authenticity and taste. We even got some local opinions.

132,0cyeXszXUE8,GOD LEVEL Chinese Food With MY FAMILY!!! INSANE Chinese Food Tour With 7 FOOD RANGER FAMILY!,"Check out https://ExpressVPN.com/thefoodranger for 3 months free w/ 1 year pack and 49% OFF! GOD LEVEL Chinese Food With The FOOD RANGER Family! Today we're going FULL ON for a DEEP Chinese Street Food and Chinese food tour of Guangzhou and Shunde in Southern China! You're going to love this Chinese Food Tour video, cause I'm bringing YOU with us and The Food Ranger Family for a HUGE Cantonese Food ADVENTURE!

My parents flew in to Guangzhou, China to come eat the best Cantonese Chinese food and to meet Ting's family. So we decided to take them for only the BEST Chinese Food in Guangdong! We're going full on, eating the BEST Dim Sum, Home cooked Chinese Food, and Roast Goose! 

To start our food and travel adventure, and in true Food Ranger style, we're going first for the BEST dim sum in Guangzhou! We brought my entire family to the White Swan restaurant, and ordered some true Cantonese food dim sum classics. We ordered shrimp and truffle shaomai dumplings, huge PLUMP hagao shrimp dumplings, black bean sauce chicken feet, and more. It was honestly the best dim sum I've ever eaten! A little expensive for this Chinese food, but so WORTH IT!

After that, we went to Guangzhou's largest seafood market to search for some delicious Chinese seafood to buy and bring back home to cook some delicious Chinese recipes with. There were massive lobsters and alaskan king crabs and more! We decided to purchase some hairy mitten crabs and steam them! Ting's mom cooked up a delicious cantonese lunch, using her home style Chinese recipes. Very delicious!

And to finish the day, we went Foodrangin' and went on a GOOSE JOURNEY to eat the BEST cantonese roast goose in the world! Master Chef Liu, owner and head chef at Datouhua restaurant in Shunde, China, has perfected and mastered the craft of making roast goose! He served us the juiciest and most plump roast goose ever and accompanied it with some BBQ pork and goose liver! It was insanely juicy and delicious!

The goose journey was worth coming to China alone for, and my parents loved it! It was the best day of Foodrangin' ever!

The detailed addresses for these Chinese street food and Chinese cuisine locations are listed below:

1) Best Dim Sum in Guangzhou:

In Southern China,  you can try some of the BEST Chinese food in the world. Here in Shunde, Guangdong, you can try some of the best street food in China and visit this amazing restaurant serving whole steamed pig and also entire roast BBQ Pig Hog!

Here in Shunde, there is a lot of amazing Chinese food and classic Chinese cuisine to eat. Both high end Cantonese cuisine and classic Chinese street food are found everywhere you look, but we came to try the whole steamed pig, and were blown away when the owner and head chef Mr. Li of the Chinese restaurant (DaBanQiao ZhengZhu) gave us a step by step lesson how to make and cook the entire pig. We watched the steamed pig but we were also served up some whole roast bbq pig as well. He showed us the whole cooking process.  First, the whole pig is laid down on a table and then covered in a spice rub, and then placed onto a huge wooden box and steamed for 40 minutes. This is truly a marvellous Chinese recipe!

We were served some classic dishes like sweet and sour pork, long string beans, steamed whole fish, and fish soup as well. This was truly a huge cantonese feast worth traveling here to try! Shunde truly has some amazing Chinese food!

How can you get real, authentic Chinese food at any Chinese restaurant? It's simple.
Secret menu. Chinese food. You guys ask me all the time if it is possible to get authentic Chinese food, real Chinese food at an American Chinese restaurant. I decided to test the theory that ANY Chinese restaurant should be able to make real Chinese food. Yes, there is a secret menu for Chinese people.

139,zsYSdyEly3,How to Cook 3 AMAZING Chinese Dishes in 15 Mins? CiCi Li - Asian Home Cooking Recipes,"How do you cook 3 dishes in 15 minutes? Today we are introducing you to 1 fish cooks 3 ways!

1whole fish
A pinch of salt
20 Shanghai bok choy
4 ounces of tofu
1 roll of glass noodles, soak in water
3 ounces of mushrooms
1 cup of minced scallions 
1 tablespoon of minced ginger
a dash of minced red pepper
1 tablespoon of julienned scallions 
1/2 tablespoon julienned ginger 
4 sliced julienned red pepper 
4 tablespoons of oil
*Keep the scallions and gingers that you don’t want anymore

Sauce：
1/2 cup of soy sauce 
2 tablespoons of smashed onion 
2 tablespoons of cilantro 
2 tablespoons of scallions 
2 cloves of garlic

Wash the fish thoroughly and dry the fish with a paper towel. Season the fish with a pinch of salt and the scallions and gingers that you no longer want on the fish to remove the fishy taste. 

In a pot, boil water, add a pinch of pepper, add the fish, and once the water is boiled again, turn to low heat. And cook for about 11 minutes. After 11 minutes, put the fish on a plate. Take out the scallions and gingers. 

Strain everything in a pot. Boil the water again, then add 20 Shanghai bok choy, once it’s boiled again. Take everything out and put them on a plate.

Now add 1 roll of glass noodles, 3 ounces of mushrooms, 4 ounces of tofu in the pot, and cook in high heat for 2 minutes. 

Now back to the fish, add 1 cup of minced scallions, 1 tablespoon of minced ginger, and a dash of minced red pepper on top of the fish. 

And now back to the boiled vegetable, add 1 tablespoon of julienned scallions, 1/2 tablespoon julienned ginger, 4 sliced julienned red pepper on top of the fish and the vegetable. 

In a small pan, heat up 4 tablespoons of oil, and pour it over the fish and the vegetable. Add the soy sauce on the side.

In this Chinese Street Food tour video, I'm going to take you on a food street journey to many delicious, mouthwatering street food places around Beijing, AKA Peking, in Northern China. If you're thinking about traveling to China for the street food, make sure to come visit Beijing. You can enjoy unique Chinese street foods hidden in Beijing's Hutong Alleyways and try some classic Chinese cuisine favorites like Peking duck AKA Beijing duck, Jian bing ( 煎饼) AKA Chinese crepes, and a ton of other hidden specialties. 
 In the past 3 years, I've shot and eaten street food around China, including locations like Chengdu, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Beijing, Wuhan, Leshan, Shanghai, and Xinjiang's Silk Road. So far, the street food in each of these locations has been the best street food around the world!
 
Chinese cuisine is so fantastic, it would really take a lifetime to eat all of it. I consider myself super lucky and fortunate to be able to live in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, eating Sichuan food and sampling food across the whole country whenever I get the chance. I've decided to stay living in China for another year or two or even more, shooting delicious street food in china for you and across asia as well!

Here are the addresses and locations and restaurant names for the Chinese street food I had in this Beijing travel video. Most locations were deep in Beijing's Hutong alleyways!

1) Famous beijing breakfast Jianbing - AKA Chinese Crepe

154,ROsHRd_,American foodies are finally embracing real Chinese food,"Chinese food in America is changing as Chinese-American immigrant identity strengthens and China's global power surges. 

With China’s economic boom, the image of its people has changed—and Chinese cuisine has developed along with it. Today, New York City is seeing a proliferation of upscale Chinese restaurants that prioritize ingredients, ambiance, and authenticity over catering to American palates. 

Earlier waves of Chinese immigrants opened restaurants as a way of getting by; their lower socioeconomic status placed Chinese cuisine at the bottom of what food studies scholars refer to as the “hierarchy of taste.” But the young, upwardly mobile restaurateurs behind these newly-opened eateries are more concerned with self-expression than survival. It’s changing how Chinese food is perceived in America, and ultimately may reshape Americans’ ideas about taste

If you are in New York — is it some of these Chinese restaurants we highlight; Ho Foods (East Village, NYC), Hunan Slurp (East Village, NYC), Spicy Village (Chinatown, LES, NYC), Le Sia (East Village, NYC), The Tang (East Village, NYC)

Luxi’s cooking school: 
Zouba Tours: 

It was another incredible day of Chinese food in Yunnan. It was a cold and rainy day, so we started with some noodles. Then we went to Luxi’s cooking class and learned how to make Chinese hot chili oil, and finally ended the day with an amazing copper hot pot of a special type of yellow beef.

Breakfast at Liu Pan Shui Mutton Vermicelli (六盘水羊肉米线) - Located in Dali Old Town, we started off the cold and rainy morning with a bowl of mutton vermicelli. The noodles were so warm and soothing and the mutton was fragrant. But probably the best thing about this Chinese breakfast was the hot chili oil, and Luxi said they had some of the best!
Price - 12 RMB ($1.82)

Wan Bao Hong Cheng Tea Shop - After breakfast, we walked over to a local tea shop to sample some Yunnan teas. Yunnan is famous for growing tea, and especially for pu’er tea, which is black, aged and fermented tea. It was a great learning opportunity, and as a tea and hot drinks lover, I fully enjoyed it.
Pu’er tea - 300 RMB ($45.47)

Rice and Friends -  Chinese Cooking Class - Luxi was our guide for a few days during this Chinese food tour trip, and she also owns a cooking school in Dali called Rice and Friends (). We first went to the market and bought a few ingredients, then we went back to her cooking school to learn a few dishes. The highlight for me was learning how to make Sichuan style hot chili oil - a condiment that you can use for just about anything and everything.

Yellow beef copper hot pot - Yunnan is known for its speciality yellow beef, and also for a style of copper hot pot. The beef and broth was insanely flavorful, and we added in a few vegetables. One of the best things about this type of Chinese hot pot is getting to make your sauce. And we must have added about 25 different ingredients and seasonings to our sauces. It was an outstanding meal, one of the best meals of my trip to Yunnan, China. 
Total price - 149 RMB ($22.57)

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 3 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven’t already, watch the full series here:

Do you know what is considered real Chinese food? It certainly is not your lo mein, pork fried rice, and sesame chicken. We live in China, and are lucky enough to eat real Chinese food everyday. But the real excitement comes when you go to the countryside in different Chinese provinces. That's when you see the real culinary diversity show it's head.
Is it dirty? Yeah, a lot of the time...
Is it delicious? Yes! Most of the time.
Does it get boring? No.

China is known for it's food, so come with us as we go dig up some local grub in a random village in the Chinese countryside and compare it to food that we get in the cities in China.

We tasted a few amazing dishes, bright and early!

First up, for breakfast, we found a lady selling this incredible milk cheese, kind of like curdled milk, right on the street. You can eat it plain or you can order it fried for breakfast with a lot of sugar. We ended up trying both. 

Then, we walked down the street and had a nice and hearty and healthy lunch soup, and rice as well. Super tasty and delicious!

Then we went for a walk and found some street ""huajuan"" rolls stuffed with fermented tofu, very strong and pungent!

All of this was found during the weekly farmers market on the street in Shaxi every friday! If you come to Yunnan in Southern China, come to Shaxi on a friday to visit one of the most amazing street markets! You have to come check it out!

After that, we went for a lunch and tasted classic bai cuisine, including local Matsutake mushrooms and amazing salted pork, which kind of tasted like pastrami! So delicious!!

190,jWS_WlojwoU,How to Find Authentic Chinese Food in America,"Chinese restaurants are like no other establishments in the United States. These places are literally the homes of thousands of Chinese families who pour out their lives into the restaurant for the sake of the next generation. From the bottom of Ying's, Justin's, and my own heart, thank you SO much to the restaurants that opened up your homes to us! 

Now onto the meaty stuff. Don't you hate when you visit a new city and don't know where to eat? Don't you hate when you're in the city you live in and don't know where to eat? I have this problem a lot so I figured, why not go out and explore? Kids, DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. You can kind of tell by the end of the video I'm getting delusional and about to pass out. 4 restaurants in 5 hours is not wise haha. But all in all, it was a really fun experience. And we learned a lot! I honestly don't usually trust yelp because of all the negative press they get about paid reviews. And I never would've thought the ""grocery store"" method would've panned out the way it did. So yeah! Hope you enjoyed! 

I know my videos are long for YouTube standards, but that's how it's going to be on this channel. I want to tell stories, and I can't tell a complete story in a 2-minute video.. so I hope that you'll stick around and watch the video all the way through!

191,MVjskBB4w0,"Chinese tourists pig out at buffet in Thailand, criticized as wasteful - TomoNews","CHIANG MAI, THAILAND — A group of Chinese tourists were caught on camera shoveling large amounts of prawns onto their plates.

The video showed the tourists climbing over each other at a hotel buffet in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in order to fill their plates with seafood. Most were employing multiple plates, using one plate to scoop food onto another, while other used their hands. Some walked away with three or four plates at a time. 

Afterwards, photos were taken of the leftover food. Most of what was taken was left uneaten,  prompting netizens to criticize the behaviour of the greedy tourists.

Most people said the behavior was shameful and lacked proper etiquette. Some were embarrassed by the behavior while others simply stated, ""That is Chinese.""

Sichuan food is one of China's 8 main cuisines. Out of all Chinese cooking, Sichuan food is my favourite Chinese food. It's spicy, numbing, fragrant, and very strong. You become addicted to Sichuan flavours and love watching and learning how to make Chinese food, as the chefs prepare it. 

Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin

Here, I shot a video with a local Chengdu girl who wanted to eat some delicious fish with me. This Sichuan fish was prepared in Garlic and a ""fragrant"" broth, which was also quite spicy. It was really delicious. Sichuan food is awesome! I brought her here to this restaurant and it was the first time she tried that flavour! I would love to have that sauce on some chicken too haha!

http://paypal.me/advchina
Wing Lam and his father, Mr. Lee introduce us to some of the best Chinese American food we've ever had at John Wayne's favorite Chinese restaurant, New Shanghai Pine Garden on Balboa Island in Newport beach. From orange chicken, to General Tso's, to fried rice and fortune cookies, we learn where Chinese American food comes from, why it was made, and who makes it best. 

SerpentZA and Laowhy86 know and love Chinese food. But if you are like most Americans, you may have never had real Chinese food. From Chow Mein to fortune cookies, American Chinese food has been altered to fit the American tastes and palate. But what if you want real Chinese food? Can you find it in America? Winston and C-milk take to the streets on a 3000 mile road trip along the USA's west coast, on a Quest for the Best Chinese food in the USA.

Xi'an is home to some of the best street food in China - with a huge muslim population that eats only halal food, with tons of beef and lamb, noodles, and more, as well as a large Han Chinese population that has it's own distinct Chinese cuisine.

You can eat so much, and I always miss the city after I leave. There is just so much food to try! You have to come here to eat!

I also really love the variety of Xi'an noodles you can try. In this street food vlog, we sample the famous spinach noodles, but there is so much more, like Xi'an biang biang noodles, and yangroupaomo rice noodles with beef as well.

208,OckvBaOcLM,The Last Cuban-Chinese Restaurant in NYC,"La Caridad 78 is a restaurant on the corner of 78th Street and Broadway in New York City's Upper West Side. The name is Spanish, yet the restaurant itself resembles a classic NY Chinese eatery. What's the deal? Well, thousands of Chinese workers came to Cuba in the 19th and 20th centuries, but fled Havana's thriving Chinatown when Castro came to power. Some of those folks came to New York. Some of *those* folks started restaurants, and, well, La Caridad 78 has been serving up some of the best Chinese AND Cuban dishes in the city since 1968. It's a story of perseverance, cultures coming together, and really, really good eats.

►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: 
►T-shirts available now: 

Day 2 in Yunnan, China was one of the greatest days of Chinese food I’ve ever had. We started by visiting Weishan, Yunnan, China, an ancient village known for delicious noodles. Then we continued on to an ancient and well preserved Muslim village, and finally had an ethnic dinner back in Dali new town.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour (it’s not sponsored), but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

The first bowl of noodles was spectacular, a seperate bowl of noodles and a dipping soup of chili oil and pork. It was the perfect way to start a cold day in Yunnan, China.
Price - 11 RMB ($1.67) per bowl

Next we tried a Chinese street food snack that’s popular in Yunnan.  A rice sheet is first grilled, then on went some pickles, peanuts, and a bunch of spices, and finally a Chinese donut was filled on the inside.
Price - 1 RMB ($0.15)

Entire bowl one noodle - Yes, the entire bowl of noodle was actually just one single noodle. It was one of the most fascinating to watch bowls ever. There’s a pan of coiled dough, which she expertly adds and stretches out as she boils it. You noodle gets cooked then topped with some vegetables and pork. It’s amazing to watch being made, and tastes delicious too.
Price -  8 RMB ($1.21)

Donglianhua (东莲花) Village - This is a well preserved ancient Muslim village, and Luxi brought us to a friend who is an outstanding cook with a gorgeous Chinese courtyard. She cooked one of the most amazing Halal beef salads I’ve ever had, plus Chinese Muslim noodles. Watching her cook everything from scratch and then eating in the courtyard environment was truly spectacular.
Xi Lian Shan (喜莲膳)
Total price - 120 RMB ($18.18)

Jingpo Yan Han Ren Jia (景颇岩罕人家) - Finally for dinner we drove back to Dali new town and ate dinner at a Jingpo restaurant, which is food from the border near Myanmar. The food was ate was not Chinese food like you would normally think, but more similar to Thai / Burmese or with Southeast Asian spices and flavors. It was an amazing meal to finish a fantastic Chinese street food tour day.
Total price - 200 RMB ($30.30)

This is Day 2 of our Chinese Food in Yunnan tour. Watch the full series here:

Not all Chinese restaurants are created equal. In some restaurants, the food on your plate may be indistinguishable from what you’d find in Beijing, but more likely, the food you awkwardly stab at with chopsticks may as well be fast food, and have all the health benefits to match. So next time you decide to just order out, remember these things you should never order from a Chinese restaurant...

I was super lucky to be able to spend Chinese New Year in Southern China, a 2 hour drive from Guangzhou, in a little village full of locals, eating an amazing feast of Chinese Food! The flavours were elegant and simple yet bold at the same time. Very refined!

I was invited to this village by a friend who was traveling back to her hometown for the Chinese New Year family reunion. When I arrived to the village, I was blown away at how traditional everything was and how the locals were so happy and kind hearted. I got to meet and chat with everyone in her family, and was shown around their home and told to make myself at home. This was a nice experience after spending time in Guangzhou eating Chinese Street Food.

I watched them cooking as they showed me how to make sweet and sour spare ribss and how to make chinese foods from southern china (Cantonese style cooking). They had an indoor kitchen and also were cooking outdoor using a massive wok! Watching them cooking and learning how to cook the way they do was an amazing experience.

The family took me in as their own, and even gave me a classic Chinese hongbao stuffed with cash!!! This was truly a experience that I will never forget! I feel so thankful!

My favourite thing was the sweet and sour spare ribs, and the boiled chicken dipped in the homemade sour and spicy chili  sauce! It was legendary!

This dish is usually prepared with chicken, peanuts, vegetables and chili peppers but the gong bao sauce has been used to created other gong bao dishes with other types of meat including frog and fish etc. For some unknown reason (really beats me), Kung Pao chicken is very popular in westernized Chinese cuisine.

The locals are super friendly here, and everything is super cheap, definitely not an expensive place to travel. The locals speak Uighur language, which I cannot, so I got by with Mandarin Chinese. It was truly amazing to come this deep into western china and to taste these super unique street food specialties!

Here are the street food locations in this video:

1) Lamb head soup - AKA Yangtoutang (this was surprisingly delicious, apart from the lung and definitely don’t order the brain!)

2) Homemade Uighur Ice Cream - SO SWEET and delicious! -

3) Ding Ding chopped hand pulled noodles (丁丁炒面）

4) Yangzasui AKA Mixed lamb organ salad - THE BEST street food I tried in this street food video

Chinese street food and Chinese food in China is something so special to me. Eating Rabbit Head in Sichuan is a MUST do thing if you visit Chengdu, China. I also got to enjoy it with a local Chinese girl, a good friend of mine, one who also loves to eat, a wonderful experience!
Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin

The first thing we had to eat was this Chinese restaurant's specialty rabbit head, a Chinese favourite, covered in a spicy, numbing, Sichuan peppercorn flavour that was quite nice.  This place was found just behind Wenshuyuan (文殊院) temple in Chengdu, near Chengdu's downtown Core.

Rabbit is not a true Chinese street food, but can be found on the street. We were lucky enough to try it right from the massive bowl on the street, as the chef had no problem with us eating it there. The chef at this Sichuan restaurant was super fun and happy. Actually, he gave the meal to us for free because we shot a video there, but I've added the proper prices in for your reference. I loved the true authentic Sichuan chopped cold rabbit salad. It was prepared with a whole roast rabbit, covered it in Sichuan chilies and peppercorns, peanuts, and cilantro. It was delicious, although a little dry.

Sichuan is famous for eating rabbit. Not all of the provinces in China eat rabbit. You can eat so many different types of rabbit dishes here, and to me, a good introduction into rabbit eating would be to chomp on a rabbit head and order up the dishes we tasted here. Yes, it can be a little nerve-wracking, but it's something that you should try. In all honesty, I didn't enjoy the head that much, as there isn't much meat, but for the fun factor alone combined with the spicy numbing flavour makes it worth trying. After eating the rabbit for 20 minutes or so, we both realized that it was much spicier than the chef had told us, and that our mouths were numbing and burning from the heat, but still enjoyable.

As my friend points out in the video, the numbing and spicy flavour is a true characteristic flavour of Sichuan. Eating rabbit head is something that many locals enjoy, soaked in ""Beautiful flavour"" （美味).

TRUE CHINESE FOOD! Eating Hot Pot in Sichuan is a MUST do thing if you visit. I also got to enjoy it with a local Chinese girl, one who also loves to eat, a wonderful experience!
Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin

The first thing we had to eat, although not technically Sichuan food, was a Chinese pastry, called huoshao, filled with a juicy, meaty, wonderful filling that was served fresh from the oven. We were super lucky to get the first ones right out of the oven after lining up for around 20 minutes. This place was found just behind Chunxi lu (Chunxi road) in Chengdu's downtown Core.

After feasting on that beautiful snack, we had to go for the real meal, the true authentic Sichuan food, Hot Pot. This is the first time I have showcased Sichuan Hot Pot in my videos. I was waiting for the right time to showcase it, and after searching for a good location and also a good partner to eat it with me (hot pot is not a one person meal), I was set to film! 

Sichuan Hot Pot is basically a huge wok filled with hot chili oil and copious amounts of Sichuan chili peppers and Sichuan numbing peppers. You place raw ingredients like raw sliced beef and raw lotus root into this boiling chili oil, and then when it's ready to eat, they take on the flavour of the substance they are boiled in. It gets spicier over time. After 40 minutes of eating hot pot, you notice that it is much much spicier than it was when you first started eating.

As my friend points out in the video, eating hotpot at night with friends is the true lifestyle of Chengdu people. Eating hot pot is what you do when you want to go out with friends and relax after work and enjoy some beautiful food (美食). They literally do call it beautiful food here, that's the lifestyle!

Uzbekistan Day 2: Tashkent

Thank you to B. Hamzaev - Head of Marketing and Promotion of Uzbekistan Tourism. Check out Bekruz: 

Also check out Ravshan’s channel: 

On Day 2 of our food tour through Uzbekistan we were spent the day eating our way through Tashkent, the largest and capital city. The day before (Day 1) we were also in Tashkent, but there was still so much more to eat.

Somsa - Uzbek somsa, or also frequently called samosa, is probably the national snack or light meal of Uzbekistan, and of Central Asia. It’s something that’s so common, I don’t think I went even a single day without eating one or many when I was in Uzbekistan - the good news is they are incredible delicious. In an area of Tashkent called Minor, I think they make the best version, famous for their teardrop shape as they droop down in the tandoor oven. The little pockets of dough are filled with mutton, onions, and light spices. They are incredibly delicious.
Price - 3,000 UZS ($0.37) per piece

Mutton fry - Next Bekruz took us to one of this favorite restaurants in Tashkent, a place located above a car wash specializing in meat, lamb of course, and fries. You order by the kilo, and we got a kilo of lamb fried in lamb fat, and a kilo of fries. But before the main platter feast we ate some kebabs, which were spectacular as well.
Total price - 48,000 UZS ($5.89)

Besh Panja- 5 fingers kebab - Another interesting kebab to eat in Uzbekistan is the 5 finger kebab because it’s prongs with 5 skewers in the shape of a hand. It was another meat snack, and it was delicious.
Price - 44,000 UZS ($5.41)

Sheep organs donut - Since it was close by, we stopped for an Uzbek snack of what Bekruz called a “hardcore Uzbek donut.” Again a pocket of dough filled with a mix of chopped up organs, and deep fried. It was tasty, especially with tomato sauce.

We then on the spur of the moment took a detour and headed out to this meat market to sample some more lamb, chicken, pickles and potatoes. People were extremely nice, and it was very fun.

Uzbek Choyhona - Experience an Uzbek Choyhona was one of the most memorable meals of my entire food tour in Uzbekistan. Along with an entire table filled with food, the main dish was an entire oxtail cooked in its own melted fat. It was insanely good. Thank you to Baha and Rashad for putting on the feast.

Thank you for watching Uzbekistan Day 2!

Stir-fried greens are an important part of any Chinese meal, and are a quick and easy thing to whip up as a side dish.  When learning how to cook these, it's best to think in terms of 'technique' and 'flavor profile'.  If you guys like this sort of thing, let us know and we can do another video one day with three more flavor profiles.

285,nwV2xWPPZ08,What You Should Absolutely Never Order From A Chinese Restaurant,"Figuring out what to eat for dinner can be an art sometimes, especially if you're ordering at a Chinese restaurant. When you get too tired to cook or are otherwise looking for a quick meal without having to resort to a drive-thru, it's comforting to know that you can pick up a tasty treat and avoid room-temperature fries at the same time. It can be tempting to order just about everything on the takeout menu and swim in a sea of egg rolls, fried rice, and chop suey, but there are a few items you should definitely avoid, especially if you're even the least bit health-conscious. 

While you might be used to scarfing down takeout boxes full of noodles, lemon chicken, and countless deep-fried goodies, you should probably take a moment to learn about all of the foods you should absolutely never order from a Chinese restaurant. We don't want to begrudge you of your mouth-watering General Tso's chicken or beef with broccoli, but we only want to let you know that these delectable dishes might be taking their toll on your body. When you order all of that deliciousness, we can bet that you're not thinking about the high calories or the levels of sodium and sugar packed in each bite. Take a moment to brace yourself and enjoy one last deep-fried egg roll dipped in duck sauce, because this list might put you off some of those dishes for a long time.

Thank you to Ronnie for this restaurant recommendation!

One of the biggest populations of Chinese Thais originate from Chaoshan (潮汕地区) region of Guangdong in China, which is often referred to as Teochew (แต้จิ๋ว) in Thailand. And so you’ll notice that lots of Thai dishes, and plenty of Thai street food dishes have origins in Teochew. But along with Chinese Thai street food, sitting down for a full authentic Thai Chinese Teochew (อาหารแต้จิ๋ว) meal, is one of the great authentic Chinese food experiences in Bangkok.

Tang Jua Lee (ร้านตั้งจั้วหลี) is a restaurant located in Bangkok’s Chinatown that’s legendary for their Chinese Teochew food. My friend Joel and I, along with Ying and Micah decided to eat here for dinner one evening. We ordered mainly their specialties:

Fish and taro steamboat (หม้อไฟเผือกปลากระพง) - Good old fashioned charcoal steamboat is what Tang Jua Lee (ร้านตั้งจั้วหลี) made a name for themselves. It was plain and pure and packed with flavor.

Chinese sashimi (ปลาดิบจีน) - The Chinese sashimi, which was some type of bighead carp, was really the dish that impressed me the most. The fish was soft and didn’t have any kind of fishy taste to it. The crust of sesame seeds is what really made it outstanding.

Oyster omelet (ออส่วน) - A fried oyster omelet is another classic Thai Chinese Teochew dish, and although it was excellent, I almost forgot about it because of how good the other dishes were.

Cold goat (แพะเย็น) - Finally, the last dish we couldn’t resist ordering on their menu because it sounded so interesting was cold goat. The goat was prepared like ham style, and apart from the mayonnaise it was served with, it was delicious and unique.

We reviewed the less than ideal food of the Brazilian fast food chain “China in the Box” in previous videos, now it's time to show everyone that real Chinese food is refined and delicious.

The menu consisted of Chinese Dumplings (popularly known as Gyozas) for Appetizers, followed by 3 entrees. Garlic stem and pork stir fry, spicy tofu skins, and steamed fish. We finished the meal with uniquely asian fruits such as Lo Gan and Dragonfruit. Let me know if you would also like to know the recipe… just need to figure out a place to put it.

►Dwight’s Channel: 
►Subscribe now for more food videos: 

Chua Kim Heng (ร้านฉั่วคิมเฮง) is a legendary Thai Chinese restaurant in Bangkok that is known most for serving braised goose, which in Thai is called han paloe (ห่านพะโล้). In Bangkok there are many restaurants that serve duck, but there aren’t too any that make goose, so any chance to eat goose, I will happily take it.

In this video, my good friend and fellow food lover Dwight, headed over to Chua Kim Heng (ร้านฉั่วคิมเฮง) to eat some braised goose and to eat another one of their specialities, a goose feet pan with egg noodles (ขาห่านอบแห้ง (ไส่หมี่) - more about this later.

Here’s everything we ate at this Thai Chinese legendary braised goose restaurant in Bangkok:

Braised goose (ห่านพะโล้) - The braised goose is braised in a secret blend of many spices, and one of the best things is watching them slice and dice the goose off the bone with expertise using some amazing Chinese cleavers. What I loved about the taste of the braised goose is that it wasn’t sweet, but quite salty, and the sauce was outstanding.

Goose feet pan (ขาห่านอบแห้ง (ไส่หมี่) - This is one of the speciality dishes at Chua Kim Heng (ร้านฉั่วคิมเฮง), and it was delicious. There were spices and herbs at the bottom of the pan, with egg noodles, and goose feet. Chicken feet aren’t typically my favorite, but goose feet on the other hand are wonderful.

Bitter melon soup (น้ำแกงมะระตุ๋น) - This dish included pork ribs and soft bitter melon. It was nice and porky, and pretty tasty.

Pea shoots with oyster sauce (โต้วเหมี่ยวน้ำมันหอย) - Finally for vegetable we got some stir fried pea shoots with oyster sauce.

Overall, the food at Chua Kim Heng (ร้านฉั่วคิมเฮง) is quite expensive, a little overpriced in my opinion. However, the 4th generation braised goose is awesome, and the goose feet are wonderful. It’s a legendary Thai Chinese goose restaurant in Bangkok.

I visited this local market near the outskirts of Chengdu, Sichuan, China, and found Chinese street food and the atmosphere to be mind blowing and exciting! It was truly an experience visiting this Chinese street market! So much food and Sichuan ingredients, so many flavours to try!

Please like: www.facebook.com/foodrangin

I visited this morning market on a Sunday morning in Chengdu at 8am with an empty stomach and money to blow with the goal of tasting foods and chatting with as many locals as possible. This is a true China experience. It was so busy, with so many people, so many things to buy and look at, tons of vegetables, meat, live chickens, live hens, live roosters, everything you could want really. Fresh handmade noodles, fresh Sichuan cold ""liangbancai"", and a huge meat market deli area with hanging pork and beef to choose from. All of the locals were friendly and talkative, although a bit surprised to see a foreigner walking through the area!

If you're visiting China as a tourist, you'll definitely want to take a walk through a busy morning market like this. There are countless street foods to try and people to chat to (If you speak a little mandarin). This market was mind blowing!

Rather than trying hot pot in Chengdu or hot pot in Chongqing, you could try some way cooler food in Chengdu at  local market like this. This should be a top priority in my opinion!

Chinese cuisine is so diverse, and I consider myself lucky to be able to live in Sichuan, eating Sichuan food everyday, tasting all the top Chinese foods to try whenever I want. I've decided to stay living in China for at least another 2 or 3 years to get the feel of it and eat as much as I can!

RECIPE IS BELOW:

Chinese Braised Pork Belly With Preserved Vegetables.  梅菜扣肉This is my mom's traditional Chinese Recipe made with preserved mustard greens.  The sauce is delicious made with Red Bean Curd.     This dish is popular in Hoiping,  China.  開平  Recipe below:

Chinese Pork Belly With Preserved Vegetables  梅菜扣肉

2 lbs. pork belly
8 oz. preserved mustard greens  (moi toi)  梅菜
1 piece red bean curd
2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons sugar
2 tablespoons sliced ginger
1 tablespoon cooking oil

Boil pork belly for 15 minutes in a large pan or pot.  Remove pork belly and pat dry with paper towel.  In a pan, add the cooking oil and grill the pork bell with the skin side down.  Grill the skin for a few minutes until brown.  Remove from pan to cool off a few minutes.  Rub dark soy sauce on all surfaces of the pork belly.    Cut the pork belly into slices of 1/4 inch thickness or slightly thicker.  Put the slice pork belly skin side down in a large bowl.

To make the sauce, put the red bean curd, salt, sugar and ginger into a bowl and mix well.  Pour sauce over pork belly slices.  If you do not have red bean curd, you can use 1 to 2 tablespoons oyster flavour sauce, or add 1 to 2 extra tablespoons dark soy sauce.  

For this recipe, you need 8 oz. of preserved mustard greens  (moi toi)   梅菜  You can buy this vegetable from Chinese supermarkets.  Wash the mustard greens in cold water.  Cut out the hard stems and stalks.  Cut the remaining mustard greens in 1/2 inch pieces. Place the mustard greens over the pork belly slices.  

In a pan, add water to cover 1/2 of pan.  Bring water to a boil.  Place the pork belly dish in the pan and cover with a lid.  Steam for 2 hours at low to medium heat.  Check to see if more water is need during the 2 hour cooking time.

Be care in removing the bowl of pork belly from the pan when the cooking time is up.  Take a slightly lager bowl and place it over the bowl with the pork belly.  Flip over the bowl of pork belly so the contents is now in the second bowl.  The skin side of the pork belly is now on the top of the second bowl.  This is really nice for presentation.  

If you do not have preserved mustard greens, you can use other vegetables such as spinach.  You can make this recipe without any vegetables if you like.  

I always like to eat rice with this dish.  The juices and sauce is absolutely delicious.  Try to find some red bean curd  (num yu) if you can.  The taste is amazing.  Enjoy!",Food

►Get my FREE e-mail updates: https://goo.gl/JK5Z8L
►Camera I use: 

On Day 27 of our Round The World Trip for food with Star Alliance, my wife and I took a day trip to Belém to do some sightseeing in Lisbon. We had the original Portuguese egg tarts from Pastéis de Belém. For dinner, we ate at a secret Chinese restaurant in Lisbon.

 Pastéis de Belém - Known to serve the original Portuguese egg tarts, which are called pastéis de Belém, we made the legendary cafe our first stop of the day. The egg tarts are incredibly good, with layers of crispy pastry and creamy egg custard in the middle. I’m not huge on pastries or sweets, but it was still good. Pastéis de Belém also has a selection of other Portuguese sweets, and we had a chocolate filled Portuguese donut at Pastéis de Belém, plus a couple cups of coffee. Total price - 6.50 EUR

 Belém Tower - There are a few very famous attractions in Lisbon located in Belém, and after the egg tart, I headed over to visited the Belém Tower, which is located within the Tagus River. After waiting in line and paying the entrance fee, I explored the tower and I especially enjoyed the view from the top. Price - 6 EUR

 Jerónimos Monastery - A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Jerónimos Monastery is an incredible feat of architecture. You have to wait in line and pay a fee get entrance into the cloister of the monastery. But it’s well worth waiting out the line because the cloister is incredible. Also, without paying you can go into the church at Jerónimos Monastery which is also spectacular. Entrance to the cloister - 10 EUR per person

 Time Out Market Lisboa - For lunch, Ying and I were hungry, but since it was a Sunday, so many of the restaurants I wanted to try were closed. So we made it back to the center of Lisbon and ended up going to the Time Out Market Lisboa. There are plenty of choices for what to eat at Time Out Market Lisboa, including both Portuguese food and international food. I ordered bacalhau with chickpeas, a famous Portuguese food combination made with salted cod.

 Museu Calouste Gulbenkian - After eating lunch at Time Out Market Lisboa, we continued on to Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, a well known art museum in Lisbon. Free entrance on Sunday

 Secret Chinese food at Chinês Clandestino Restaurant - Ying and I were both still hungry after only a small lunch. Again, most of the Portuguese food restaurants I wanted to eat at were closed on Sunday, so we both decided to eat Chinese food. After doing some searching I came across Chinês Clandestino Restaurant, a Chinese restaurant with no signs. The food was overall quite good, and I have to admit that both Ying and I were ready for some Chinese food! Total price - 27.20 EUR for everything

 A Ginjinha - I had already ended the video for the day, but when I was A Ginjinha as we walked home, I decided to stop in this legendary takeaway bar and try a cup of Portuguese cherry ginginha. It was a great way to end the day.

Day 26 was alright. I was a little disappointed we weren’t able to eat authentic Portuguese food, but things don’t always work out the way you expected them to when you travel, and that’s alright.

Disclaimer and Thank You: 
Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets () for sponsoring my business class flights.

If an Australian tries Chinese food does that mean he can't try Chinese snacks? (Relatable Youtube problems.)

Chinese cuisine includes styles originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world including most Asian nations. The history of Chinese cuisine in China stretches back for thousands of years and has changed from period to period and in each region according to climate, imperial fashions, and local preferences. Over time, techniques and ingredients from the cuisines of other cultures were integrated into the cuisine of the Chinese people due both to imperial expansion and from the trade with nearby regions in pre-modern times, and from Europe and the New World in the modern period. Contrary to the beliefs of many, the usage of dairy can be traced to ancient recipes as early as 9th century B.C. Animals such as buffalos are important to agriculture and their dairy products are part of the Chinese diet and nomads also had influence on Chinese diets. However, it was not legal to consume beef over part of the ancient history. The belief that farming animals are sacred and beef is for the highest ritual has been lasting and influencial, as same clauses existed in ancient Japanese and Korean laws.

The ""Eight Culinary Cuisines"" of China[1] are Anhui, Cantonese, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang cuisines.

The staple foods of Chinese cooking include rice, noodles, vegetables, and sauces and seasonings.

HONEY WALNUT SHRIMP RECIPE
printable recipe -  
1 lbs Large Shrimp
2 egg whites
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 C water
1/2 C sugar
1 C walnut halves
1/2 C cornstarch
1 C oil
1/3 C mayo - Asian Mayo will give you a more authentic flavor
3 Tbsp honey
2 Tbsp condensed milk
2 tsp lemon juice
Pat shrimp dry
whip the egg whites and salt until foamy
put the shrimp in the egg white mixture, stir and leave for 30 mins
In a small sauce pan bring the water and sugar to a boil and boil until it starts to turn golden (I'd do it a little less than I did in the video - but it's all about the flavor you want on your candied walnuts)
spread onto a silpat mat, they'll harden right away
put the cornstarch in a large ziplock bag - and put the shrimp in, shake until all the shrimp are coated
heat the oil and fry the shrimp - half at a time - once you see the shrimp start to curl and you see pink flip right away - it will curl a little more - don't over cook - pull out and let drain on a wire rack over a paper towel (not directly onto a paper towel - they will get soggy)
in another bowl mix the Mayo, honey, condensed milk and lemon juice - stir
add the shrimp and stir to coat
to with the walnuts and serve with rice!

329,7_wzJqc-_iY,How-To: Make Cold Buckwheat Noodles with Mission Chinese Food,"In this episode of How-To, Danny Bowien and Angela Dimayuga of Mission Chinese Food make naengmyeon, or cold buckwheat noodles, in the MUNCHIES Test Kitchen. 

These chewy buckwheat noodles with an icy broth are served with a variety of condiments (mustard cured eggs, peach-chili sauce, and fresh herbs) and delight the senses with their cold temperature and spicy flavors. Although this might seem like a summer dish, in Korea, it's common to eat cold dishes in the winter. So next time it snows, try making this dish instead of a hot soup.

332,dv7Z-5ikqmI,Cooking Asian Food in the Chinese Wok.,"One good video about cooking Asian food. This free video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be re-used for free, under the creative commons license, with the attribution of epSos.de as the original creator of this video about cooking Asian food.

Thank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!

The Asian food has won over the world. The Chinese wok is an important instrument for the cooking of Asian food. In this video we can see the cooking process of Asian food in the Chinese wok. The strong fire creates a hot temperature. The food heats up and can cook very fast. In this video the food is already cooked, so that the wok has only to heat up the food, and to fry the vegetables with spicy oil on the skin of the vegetables.

The Chinese wok is the traditional tool for the cooks in Asia. The Chinese wok can heat up very fast, and is more comfortable on a large fire. The Chinese wok is the perfect tool for the cooking of large portions on a gas stove. The fire is the best friend of the Chinese wok. When the fire is large and strong, then is is very important that the food is mixed very often. The heat can be very strong at the bottom of the Chinese wok. The sides of the wok can also heat up very well, because the Chinese wok can capture a lot of heat from the fire.

The first step of the cooking in the Chinese wok is always the heat. When the wok is hot, the it is possible to add water or oil. The cooks in China use oil and spices for the creation of the flavor, before they put the food into the hot wok. There is a modern Chinese wok for the electric stove, or the induction stove too. The modern wok, for the electric stove, has a flat bottom and a round shape inside of the wok. It is practical for cooking at home, when there is no access to a gas stove.

In this video we can see a Chinese cook, who is cooking in the Chinese fast food restaurant. The kitchen is very fast. The fire is strong and the cook has too cook one meal in every 3 minutes. It is a very fast environment with many customers. The noodles are all ready for eating, when the Chinese cook is putting them into the wok. The strong fire is only used for the vegetables, the eggs, the spices and oil that is providing the flavor to the Chinese noodles.

The Chinese wok can be used for boiling, cooking, frying, steaming, or even as a bowl for the salads. The Chinese wok is the universal tool for the traditional kitchen in China. The ancient Chinese traditions are now more and more popular in the western world, because the  people love to try new food and to eat something that is different from the classical food in the western countries. The Chinese wok is slowly becoming a popular took in the restaurants of the western countries, because it can be used for large portions with a lot of control over the temperature of the food inside of the Chinese wok.

Cooking is a very physical job. The traditional Chinese food does require a lot of physical work and movement. The Chinese wok is the product of many years of evolution. The modern shape of the Chinese wok is the perfect result of an efficient design. The Chinese wok has one grip for the hand. The sides of the wok are tall and round, so that no food can spill out. The bottom is round and there is a small surface at the center of the bottom. This small surface can collect heat and send it to the sides of the wok and to the center of the food. The Chinese wok has a very good distribution of the heat.
