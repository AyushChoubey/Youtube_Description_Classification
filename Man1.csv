19,F5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. 

Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July – 12 November 2017) 

Sponsored by MADE.COM. Supported by the American Friends of the V&A

62,IFFxGRQefEQ,Top 10 Car Manufacturing Companies in India | Top 10 car manufacturers in India,"Top 10 Car Manufacturing Companies in India




Maruti Suzuki leads from the front with a massive market share of over 49 percent followed by Hyundai Motor India. Here is a complete analysis of auto sales in India and what to expect going forward in 2018. With all eyes on Auto Expo 2018, expect car sales in India to further grow this year. Please follow the list below :


* 10. Volkswagen: This German manufacturer just edges past Chevrolet to make it into this Top 10 list for 2018. A large part of its success is driven by the Polo hatchback and Vento sedan models. As part of the Volkswagen AG group, brands like Audi and Skoda also contribute to the sales numbers.

* 9. Nissan: The Indian arm of Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan Motor Company's wholesale deliveries reported an increase of 39 percent in April 2017 to 4,217 vehicles. The company, in a statement, has credited this growth in sales to customer demand for the Datsun Redi-GO.
 
* 8. Ford India: As a brand, Ford has its share of loyalists in India. Their Ikon 1.6 and subsequently Fiesta S have been driver-centric cars. At the other end of the market, they also have the Endeavour – one of India’s’ first true SUVs, with a ladder-on-frame construction, butch styling, and impressive road presence.

* 7. Renault: This French manufacturer has a range that covers most segments in the Indian market. They have the entry-level Pulse hatchback, which is a rebadged Nissan Micra, as part of its alliance with Nissan Motors in India. The Scala sedan is a popular sedan and shares its market space with the Nissan Sunny.

* 6. Toyota: The name has become synonymous with quality. This has been a constant refrain with the owners and drivers of its most popular product in India, the Innova. Despite the premium pricing and long waiting periods, the Innova continues to be the market leader in its segment every month.

* 5. Honda Cars: As a brand name, Honda has always held a special place in the hearts of Indians. The interiors are of good quality, and the ride and handling are comfortable. Honda’s after sales service is one of the best and is responsible for most of its repeat customers.

* 4. Tata Motors: A massive automotive company with an incredible range of vehicles, Tata nevertheless has struggled sometimes when it comes to passenger cars. They had a very successful run with the Indica and Indigo series of hatchbacks and sedans.

* 3. Mahindra & Mahindra: India popular home-grown automaker, Mahindra has been a leader in transportation in rural areas. They have focused on a strong, rugged image and built a reputation for reliability. Coupled with value for money features, Mahindra vehicles have become known for being easy to own and cheap to maintain.

* 2. Hyundai India: As a brand, Hyundai was unknown when it launched in India. From there to becoming India’s second Best build car brand is a success story that needs to be told. The very first model they launched, the Santro was an unmitigated success.

* 1. Maruti Suzuki: Our very own Maruti Suzuki holds an impressive 42% of the market at the end of last month. They sold over 92000 vehicles in thirty days. And this was not a great month – in fact, it was the lowest in over a year. The average monthly sales are actually over 110000.

84,qIcV09YbAE,Artificial intelligence in manufacturing: Game changer or just another hype?,"Most people agree that artificial intelligence will have a huge impact on the way Europeans will produce and consume in the future. However, there are differing views on what the European Union can do to tap the full potential of AI in manufacturing and while coping with possible challenges.

The debate is often driven by pessimistic scenarios such as disrupted industrial structures and mass unemployment. This rarely reflects the daily life of European manufacturers who develop ways to use AI for a more efficient and clean production – and who need a political framework for the use of such technologies. In April, the European Commission published its AI strategy with the aim to facilitate the uptake of AI in Europe. 

EURACTIV organised this workshop to discuss how AI is used by manufacturers and the regulatory framework at the Union level. Questions included:

- Will AI disrupt industry, or will it be just another step in its evolution?
- Do we need new EU legislation, for instance new liability rules?
- Is the Commission’s recent Communication on AI appropriate and strong enough?
- Is the European industry competitive compared to superpowers like the US or China in the field of AI? Does the EU risk lagging behind?
- Will AI lead to mass unemployment in Europe? What can be done to prevent it?",Manufacturing

88,7YvJB0n16I,Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing (Free Simulation),"Lean Simulation:  Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing

This video shows a preview of a Push versus Pull computer simulation model by The Big Lean Simulation Library:  



From here, you can obtain the full version of the video tutorial, the simulation model itself, and how-to instructions for demonstrating the model.  You can show this as part of your Lean Six Sigma course offerings (LSS White Belt, Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt.).  Lean and Lean Six Sigma consultants can also use it as a tool to sell your Lean consulting work to management and executives.  Advanced practitioners will already know the concepts but will appreciate the ability to show them to others in an easy to understand format.

This simulation consists of three scenarios.

Scenario 1:  This shows a push manufacturing system.  The first workstation produces a run of 100 parts.  The second workstation processes those parts at a slower rate.  As a result, the ""pushed"" parts add excess inventory and Work-In-Process (WIP).  In addition, the first workstation experiences a quality problem after 30 documents.  As a result, about 70 defective parts are produced before the downstream workstation catches the problem and tells the first workstation.

Scenario 2:  In this scenario, we use a Pull based kanban system to process parts only when the second workstation is able to process them.  As a result, key metrics for Work-In-Process and quality are dramatically improved while still producing at the same rate.

Scenario 3:  Travel time is reduced, thus allowing fewer kanbans.  All metrics are improved further.

The final view shows optional discussion bullet points.

                                     Industry 4.0 is a name given to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things, cloud computing and cognitive computing. Industry 4.0 is commonly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution.

Industry 4.0 fosters what has been called a ""smart factory"". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. Over the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real-time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the value chain.

                     Smart manufacturing is a broad category of manufacturing that employs computer-integrated manufacturing, high levels of adaptability and rapid design changes, digital information technology, and more flexible technical workforce training. Other goals sometimes include fast changes in production levels based on demand,optimization of the supply chain, efficient production and recyclability. In this concept, as smart factory has interoperable systems, multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation, intelligent automation, strong cyber security, and networked sensors.

Bleaching powder is also called calcium chlorohypochlorite because it is considered as a mixed salt of hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid. Bleaching Powder is an oxidizing agent and the activity is measured in terms of available chlorine, which is the same weight as that of gaseous or liquid chlorine that would exert the same action as the chlorine compound. Bleaching powder is used to whiting or removing the natural color of textile fibers, yarns, wood pulp, paper and other products by chemical reaction and also is an additive in the scouring powder preparation as germicide.

Bleacing powder is calcium hypochlorite (Ca (OCl) 2). It is a one of the major chemical industry in the world. Limestone and chlorine gas are used as raw materials to manufacture bleaching powder which is used as a disinfectant and as an oxidizing agent. Bleaching powder show different reactions.

108,HiMzDP3pU,The New Manufacturing: Ted Hall at TEDxRichmond,"Ted Hall, founder and CEO of ShopBot Tools, Inc., first got excited about digital fabrication 20 years ago. Ted wanted a digitally controlled tool that would cut plywood parts for backyard boatbuilding projects. In trying to find such a tool, he learned that the CNC (computer numerically controlled) technology of the time was heavily industrial and oriented to high-volume manufacturing. Ted's idea, which would become ShopBot, was to create a digital fabrication tool that was instead oriented to use by individuals and small shops. A tool that took advantage of the technology's capability to cut, drill, sculpt, machine, carve, or trim with high precision and in relation to a digital model -- but that made sense in a small shop for making one object or many, and that empowered individuals through the new technology with enhanced capabilities to express their creativity in projects of all sizes and using a wide range of materials.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Manufacturing

It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas:  

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:   

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create “patterns” which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won’t be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

122,fRYIJuq6l4,Manufacturing Day 2013,"Manufacturing sure ain't what it used to be. Gone are the days where every manufacturing job meant backbreaking and/or dangerous labor. Though a great amount of skill is still required these days to produce consistently high quality products in large volumes, many production environments are now equipped with both safer materials and high-precision, lower-force robotics that allow us to build more intricate devices than ever before.

Here at SparkFun, we embrace our robotic friends that work tirelessly to help us produce thousands of circuit boards and electronics kits each day for the innovators, tinkerers, creative technologists, and tech education providers all across the world. We appreciate our machines for their quirks (robots aren't perfect, you know) so long as they don't frown upon our own. True to our D.I.Y. ethos, we have always believed that it is far more satisfying to manufacture our own product designs rather than outsource them to someone else. And, as is to be expected, we have learned many valuable lessons as the demand for our circuit boards and kits has grown over the years. But through those lessons, we continue to improve. We believe that our success lies in our openness to trying new things, dedicating ourselves to an insatiable appetite for high quality products, and being true to who we are without regard for ""industry norms.""

It is always rewarding to see the endless stream of amazing projects from the D.I.Y. community come to life, with the circuit boards and kits that we personally built here in Boulder, CO, playing a small role in those creations! A big thank you to those of you who share with us and the world what you have built and what you have learned through your own designing and building! And thank you for being as truly unique and geeky as we are...

127,Kslh8XUphJ,IACMI Wind Blade Prototype (Composites Manufacturing Innovation),"Knoxville, TN, January 31, 2017— The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) unveiled an advanced technology prototype wind blade during the Winter IACMI members meeting February 1-2 in Denver, Colorado. The nine- meter long blade was fabricated at IACMI’s Wind Technology Area in the Denver, Colorado area. Commercialization of the wind blade prototype created could speed production times, reduce manufacture cost, and provide stronger, more energy-efficient blades for the United States.

A large team of eleven industrial partners, including Arkema Inc., Johns Manville, TPI Composites Inc., Huntsman Polyurethanes, Strongwell, DowAksa USA, Chomarat North America, Composites One, SikaAxson, Creative Foam and Chem-Trend, provided materials and on site fabrication support for blade component manufacturing and assembly. Pultruded spar caps were fabricated at Strongwell in Bristol, Virginia and shipped to Colorado for incorporation into the blade shells. The project was led by IACMI’s Wind Technology Area, based in the Denver, Colorado area , with support from IACMI Headquarters, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Advanced Industries Program administered by the Colorado Office of Economic Trade and Development (OEDIT).

The prototype blade is based on an existing design from previous work conducted by the DOE, representing a small-scale version of a utility-scale multi-megawatt blade. The new blade, molded on tooling supplied by TPI Composites, Inc., features innovations such as impact resistant components, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic parts and exterior shell components produced with less than half the normal CO2 emissions commonly emitted in wind blade manufacture.",Manufacturing

165,F5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. 

Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July – 12 November 2017)

208,IFFxGRQefEQ,Top 10 Car Manufacturing Companies in India | Top 10 car manufacturers in India,"Top 10 Car Manufacturing Companies in India




Maruti Suzuki leads from the front with a massive market share of over 49 percent followed by Hyundai Motor India. Here is a complete analysis of auto sales in India and what to expect going forward in 2018. With all eyes on Auto Expo 2018, expect car sales in India to further grow this year. Please follow the list below :


* 10. Volkswagen: This German manufacturer just edges past Chevrolet to make it into this Top 10 list for 2018. A large part of its success is driven by the Polo hatchback and Vento sedan models. As part of the Volkswagen AG group, brands like Audi and Skoda also contribute to the sales numbers.

* 9. Nissan: The Indian arm of Japanese automobile manufacturer Nissan Motor Company's wholesale deliveries reported an increase of 39 percent in April 2017 to 4,217 vehicles. The company, in a statement, has credited this growth in sales to customer demand for the Datsun Redi-GO.
 
* 8. Ford India: As a brand, Ford has its share of loyalists in India. Their Ikon 1.6 and subsequently Fiesta S have been driver-centric cars. At the other end of the market, they also have the Endeavour – one of India’s’ first true SUVs, with a ladder-on-frame construction, butch styling, and impressive road presence.

* 7. Renault: This French manufacturer has a range that covers most segments in the Indian market. They have the entry-level Pulse hatchback, which is a rebadged Nissan Micra, as part of its alliance with Nissan Motors in India. The Scala sedan is a popular sedan and shares its market space with the Nissan Sunny.

* 6. Toyota: The name has become synonymous with quality. This has been a constant refrain with the owners and drivers of its most popular product in India, the Innova. Despite the premium pricing and long waiting periods, the Innova continues to be the market leader in its segment every month.

* 5. Honda Cars: As a brand name, Honda has always held a special place in the hearts of Indians. The interiors are of good quality, and the ride and handling are comfortable. Honda’s after sales service is one of the best and is responsible for most of its repeat customers.

* 4. Tata Motors: A massive automotive company with an incredible range of vehicles, Tata nevertheless has struggled sometimes when it comes to passenger cars. They had a very successful run with the Indica and Indigo series of hatchbacks and sedans.

* 3. Mahindra & Mahindra: India popular home-grown automaker, Mahindra has been a leader in transportation in rural areas. They have focused on a strong, rugged image and built a reputation for reliability. Coupled with value for money features, Mahindra vehicles have become known for being easy to own and cheap to maintain.

* 2. Hyundai India: As a brand, Hyundai was unknown when it launched in India. From there to becoming India’s second Best build car brand is a success story that needs to be told. The very first model they launched, the Santro was an unmitigated success.

* 1. Maruti Suzuki: Our very own Maruti Suzuki holds an impressive 42% of the market at the end of last month. They sold over 92000 vehicles in thirty days. And this was not a great month – in fact, it was the lowest in over a year. The average monthly sales are actually over 110000.

230,qIcV09YbAE,Artificial intelligence in manufacturing: Game changer or just another hype?,"Most people agree that artificial intelligence will have a huge impact on the way Europeans will produce and consume in the future. However, there are differing views on what the European Union can do to tap the full potential of AI in manufacturing and while coping with possible challenges.

The debate is often driven by pessimistic scenarios such as disrupted industrial structures and mass unemployment. This rarely reflects the daily life of European manufacturers who develop ways to use AI for a more efficient and clean production – and who need a political framework for the use of such technologies. In April, the European Commission published its AI strategy with the aim to facilitate the uptake of AI in Europe. 

EURACTIV organised this workshop to discuss how AI is used by manufacturers and the regulatory framework at the Union level. Questions included:

- Will AI disrupt industry, or will it be just another step in its evolution?
- Do we need new EU legislation, for instance new liability rules?
- Is the Commission’s recent Communication on AI appropriate and strong enough?
- Is the European industry competitive compared to superpowers like the US or China in the field of AI? Does the EU risk lagging behind?
- Will AI lead to mass unemployment in Europe? What can be done to prevent it?",Manufacturing

234,7YvJB0n16I,Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing (Free Simulation),"Lean Simulation:  Push vs Pull with Kanban - Manufacturing

This video shows a preview of a Push versus Pull computer simulation model by The Big Lean Simulation Library:  



From here, you can obtain the full version of the video tutorial, the simulation model itself, and how-to instructions for demonstrating the model.  You can show this as part of your Lean Six Sigma course offerings (LSS White Belt, Yellow Belt, Green Belt, Black Belt, Master Black Belt.).  Lean and Lean Six Sigma consultants can also use it as a tool to sell your Lean consulting work to management and executives.  Advanced practitioners will already know the concepts but will appreciate the ability to show them to others in an easy to understand format.

This simulation consists of three scenarios.

Scenario 1:  This shows a push manufacturing system.  The first workstation produces a run of 100 parts.  The second workstation processes those parts at a slower rate.  As a result, the ""pushed"" parts add excess inventory and Work-In-Process (WIP).  In addition, the first workstation experiences a quality problem after 30 documents.  As a result, about 70 defective parts are produced before the downstream workstation catches the problem and tells the first workstation.

Scenario 2:  In this scenario, we use a Pull based kanban system to process parts only when the second workstation is able to process them.  As a result, key metrics for Work-In-Process and quality are dramatically improved while still producing at the same rate.

Scenario 3:  Travel time is reduced, thus allowing fewer kanbans.  All metrics are improved further.

The final view shows optional discussion bullet points.

Note – This is the same as the Office version, except with a different motif.",Manufacturing

                                     Industry 4.0 is a name given to the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. It includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things, cloud computing and cognitive computing. Industry 4.0 is commonly referred to as the fourth industrial revolution.

Industry 4.0 fosters what has been called a ""smart factory"". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. Over the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real-time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the value chain.

                     Smart manufacturing is a broad category of manufacturing that employs computer-integrated manufacturing, high levels of adaptability and rapid design changes, digital information technology, and more flexible technical workforce training. Other goals sometimes include fast changes in production levels based on demand,optimization of the supply chain, efficient production and recyclability. In this concept, as smart factory has interoperable systems, multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation, intelligent automation, strong cyber security, and networked sensors.
             Big data processing
Smart manufacturing utilizes big data analytics, to refine complicated processes and manage supply chains.[7] Big data analytics refers to a method for gathering and understanding large data sets .
The broad definition of smart manufacturing covers many different technologies. Some of the key technologies in the smart manufacturing movement include big data processing capabilities, industrial connectivity devices and services, and advanced robotics.

Bleaching powder is also called calcium chlorohypochlorite because it is considered as a mixed salt of hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid. Bleaching Powder is an oxidizing agent and the activity is measured in terms of available chlorine, which is the same weight as that of gaseous or liquid chlorine that would exert the same action as the chlorine compound. Bleaching powder is used to whiting or removing the natural color of textile fibers, yarns, wood pulp, paper and other products by chemical reaction and also is an additive in the scouring powder preparation as germicide.

Bleacing powder is calcium hypochlorite (Ca (OCl) 2). It is a one of the major chemical industry in the world. Limestone and chlorine gas are used as raw materials to manufacture bleaching powder which is used as a disinfectant and as an oxidizing agent. Bleaching powder show different reactions.

254,HiMzDP3pU,The New Manufacturing: Ted Hall at TEDxRichmond,"Ted Hall, founder and CEO of ShopBot Tools, Inc., first got excited about digital fabrication 20 years ago. Ted wanted a digitally controlled tool that would cut plywood parts for backyard boatbuilding projects. In trying to find such a tool, he learned that the CNC (computer numerically controlled) technology of the time was heavily industrial and oriented to high-volume manufacturing. Ted's idea, which would become ShopBot, was to create a digital fabrication tool that was instead oriented to use by individuals and small shops. A tool that took advantage of the technology's capability to cut, drill, sculpt, machine, carve, or trim with high precision and in relation to a digital model -- but that made sense in a small shop for making one object or many, and that empowered individuals through the new technology with enhanced capabilities to express their creativity in projects of all sizes and using a wide range of materials.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.

It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas:  

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:   

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create “patterns” which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won’t be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

268,fRYIJuq6l4,Manufacturing Day 2013,"Manufacturing sure ain't what it used to be. Gone are the days where every manufacturing job meant backbreaking and/or dangerous labor. Though a great amount of skill is still required these days to produce consistently high quality products in large volumes, many production environments are now equipped with both safer materials and high-precision, lower-force robotics that allow us to build more intricate devices than ever before.

Here at SparkFun, we embrace our robotic friends that work tirelessly to help us produce thousands of circuit boards and electronics kits each day for the innovators, tinkerers, creative technologists, and tech education providers all across the world. We appreciate our machines for their quirks (robots aren't perfect, you know) so long as they don't frown upon our own. True to our D.I.Y. ethos, we have always believed that it is far more satisfying to manufacture our own product designs rather than outsource them to someone else. And, as is to be expected, we have learned many valuable lessons as the demand for our circuit boards and kits has grown over the years. But through those lessons, we continue to improve. We believe that our success lies in our openness to trying new things, dedicating ourselves to an insatiable appetite for high quality products, and being true to who we are without regard for ""industry norms.""

It is always rewarding to see the endless stream of amazing projects from the D.I.Y. community come to life, with the circuit boards and kits that we personally built here in Boulder, CO, playing a small role in those creations! A big thank you to those of you who share with us and the world what you have built and what you have learned through your own designing and building! And thank you for being as truly unique and geeky as we are...

273,Kslh8XUphJ,IACMI Wind Blade Prototype (Composites Manufacturing Innovation),"Knoxville, TN, January 31, 2017— The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) unveiled an advanced technology prototype wind blade during the Winter IACMI members meeting February 1-2 in Denver, Colorado. The nine- meter long blade was fabricated at IACMI’s Wind Technology Area in the Denver, Colorado area. Commercialization of the wind blade prototype created could speed production times, reduce manufacture cost, and provide stronger, more energy-efficient blades for the United States.

A large team of eleven industrial partners, including Arkema Inc., Johns Manville, TPI Composites Inc., Huntsman Polyurethanes, Strongwell, DowAksa USA, Chomarat North America, Composites One, SikaAxson, Creative Foam and Chem-Trend, provided materials and on site fabrication support for blade component manufacturing and assembly. Pultruded spar caps were fabricated at Strongwell in Bristol, Virginia and shipped to Colorado for incorporation into the blade shells. The project was led by IACMI’s Wind Technology Area, based in the Denver, Colorado area , with support from IACMI Headquarters, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Advanced Industries Program administered by the Colorado Office of Economic Trade and Development (OEDIT).

The prototype blade is based on an existing design from previous work conducted by the DOE, representing a small-scale version of a utility-scale multi-megawatt blade. The new blade, molded on tooling supplied by TPI Composites, Inc., features innovations such as impact resistant components, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic parts and exterior shell components produced with less than half the normal CO2 emissions commonly emitted in wind blade manufacture.",Manufacturing
