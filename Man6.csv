In a previous post, we took a behind-the-scenes look at adidas' latest offering in the form of the Ultra Boost running shoe. Now, in an HYPEBEAST PROCESS video, we get to watch the entire process in the production of the latest sneaker. Despite living in the modern age where nearly everything that is created is done so by autonomous machinery, it's refreshing to see that there is some level of human intervention to produce the polished product. From the complete knitted uppers to boxing the complete pair, this short exploration  in the construction of the Ultra Boost sheds light on the breakdown of the minimal, lightweight running shoe, and the attention to detail implemented by the workers.

5,UPtS-SgaJYM,Handmade shoes factory Vietnam,"‚ñ† SAIGON, VIETNAM: Vietnam's economy is booming with small scale manufacturers popping up everywhere. Jeans, shoes, t-shirts and everything between heaven and earth are made in workshops where workers are laboring away at an impressive 17 hours a day. 

So what does it look like inside one of these operations? And how are the good produced?

As Vietnam is quite far behind the West in terms of economic development and only begun the process of industrialization a few decades ago, it should come as no surprise that manufacturing here is a highly labor intensive endeavor. 

So join me as I take a closer look at Vietnam's economy by touring a shoe manufacturing business that has been in the hands of the same family for 30 years.",Manufacturing

The shoe progresses from ""clicking"" or cutting of the leather components, through ""closing"" or stitching and fitting of the various components to make the upper.  The upper is then ""lasted"", a sole is directly injection moulded onto the upper and finally shoe roomed, inspected and boxed.

Unlike many fully automatic manufacturing processes, shoe making is still very labour intensive and involves a great many manual steps.

In a bid to tackle the unemployment issue, Manipur introduced ‚ÄòMake in Manipur‚Äô scheme to generate job opportunities and create platforms for the unemployed youths. Amongst the ‚ÄòMake in Manipur‚Äô products, shoe manufacturing units in the state are also training local men and women and making them a skilled employee. Laishram Chamba Singh, the proprietor of Super Shoes factory, is one such entrepreneur who organises workshops and trains both men and women hailing from different parts of the state. Founded in 1976 and later registered in Khadi and Village Industries Commissioner, Imphal, under shoe manufacturing cottage industry in the year 2011, Chamba has trained over 500 individuals in making shoes. Presently employs 19 artisans, Chamba‚Äôs company excels in producing handmade and knitted shoes and sandals for ladies especially. Shoe making has become a thriving business due to ever increasing demand from the consumers in the state and country as a whole. Such novelty steps and ventures add another feature to its cap in ‚ÄòMake in Manipur‚Äô scheme.

52,nSOt-H2kxmM,How To Make Shoes | Custom Sneakers From The Sole Up,"Have you ever wanted to know how to make shoes? We spend most of our life wearing sneakers so in this video I take you inside of a factory that makes thousands of custom shoes to show you how they‚Äôre made. Start your brand with this free online training‚Üí 

I recently traveled to Leon, Mexico known as the shoe capital of the world in search of discovering how to make shoes. What I observed is that the process of making a custom sneakers is time intensive when it comes to manufacturing. In order to make a custom shoe line from scratch (from the soles to the uppers), it requires weeks of prep time and can take months to complete!

Inside of this video you will find the key steps involved in the shoe making process including:

*Shoe Design & Pattern Making *
The process of designing and creating patterns for a shoe begins by applying tape to a shoe last. The designer will then draw their idea on top of the tape, which is then cut from the last and made into a digital pattern. 

*Sampling The Design*
Once the digital patterns are created they are made into physical patterns which are placed on the desired fabrics for the shoe design. The sample makers than take the cut pieces and make the one off design. Once the shoes are approved, the manufacturing process begins.

*Creating The Shoe Mold*
The shoe mold is designed in a CAD based system which is then made into a physical block with a CNC machine. The CNC machine engraves the design of the shoe sole into a metal block. This metal block is then inspected and prepared for the injection molding process, creating the base for the sneakers, heels and a variety of pieces needed for custom shoe designs. 

*Metallization Process*
Some shoes have pieces that need a metallic finish, and during the metallization process plastic is put into a large vacuum which binds the metal to the plastic components.

*Injection Molding*
Using the shoe mold created with the CNC machine the sole of the shoes are instantly produced inside of the mold injection machine. Allowing thousand of shoe soles to be made every day. 

*Fabric Cutting*
There are two different ways that fabrics for a large sneaker production can be cut; on a laser cutting machine or die cut. A laser cutter is able to cut pieces fairly quickly, but is usually used for runs lower than 5,000 pairs of shoes. Die Cutting is used for larger runs and is more efficient as you can stack multiple layers of fabrics and cut them all at once. 

*Sewing and Completing The Shoe*
A variety of sewing machines, presses and gluing processes are required in the finishing of a shoe. Each shoe design has its own set up involved, and throughout this video we share all of the processes in detail for you to better understand how to make custom shoes.

Focus on the audio comprising of natural sounds, as you see the process unfurl!

Shoemaking is the process of making footwear. Originally, shoes were made one at a time by hand. Traditional handicraft shoemaking has now been largely superseded in volume of shoes produced by industrial mass production of footwear, but not necessarily in quality, attention to detail, or craftsmanship.

Shoemakers or cordwainers (cobblers being, historically, those who repair shoes) may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material, and often consist of multiple parts for better durability of the sole, stitched to a leather upper.

Britain‚Äôs last remaining shoe manufacturer is looking to take great strides in post-brexit Britain - eyeing up continued expansion in far-flung markets.

Dennis Crompton and his brother Jon bought are proud owners of Norman Walsh footwear in their hometown of Bolton, Greater Manchester.

They bought the company from its eponymous founder in 1996 after falling in love with his trainers in the 1970s.

Norman, who was selected to make the running shoes worn by Roger Bannister during his four-minute mile attempt, founded Norman Walsh in 1961.

His original designs are still so successful that the firm simply looks through the archives and tweaks them whenever they bring out a new product.

Sherwani juttis are handmade shoes done by experienced skilled artisans located in remote corners of the country. But in modern days these type of juttis are found and sold in local areas of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Varanasi. Sherwani shoes are usually identified by their uniqueness of being pointed toe, flat and straight sole that does not show the variation between left and right foot. The designs are very intrinsic and delicate with the precious gems, pearls and precious stone works. They are the perfect outfit that provides an essential ethnic appeal for religious occasions, parties, festivals and weddings.

Beyonc√© wore a custom pair of boots for her Coachella performance, and Cardi B slipped on a pair of ""bloody shoes"" for her ""Bodak Yellow"" music video. But why do these heels cost hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of dollars?

Following is a transcript of the video:

Narrator: What makes these shoes worth almost $800? Christian Louboutin is the mastermind behind these iconic red-bottomed shoes. It's safe to say his footwear has stepped into the mainstream. Celebrities all over the world wear them.

""You know the ones with the high heels and the red bottoms?""

‚ô™ These expensive, these is red bottoms ‚ô™ ‚ô™ These is bloody shoes ‚ô™

Narrator: Louboutin even had the red bottoms trademarked. The signature Louboutin pumps, start at $695. The most expensive pair, nearly $6,000. So how did this craze start? Christian Louboutin had the idea for red soles in 1993. An employee was painting her nails red. Louboutin snagged the bottle and painted the soles of a prototype shoe. Just like that, the red soles were born.

So, what makes these shoes worth the cost? In 2013, when the New York Times asked Louboutin, why his shoes are so expensive, he blamed production costs. Louboutin said, ""It's expensive to make shoes in Europe."" From 2008 to 2013, he said his company's production costs had doubled as the euro strengthened against the dollar, and competition increased for quality materials from factories in Asia.

David Mesquita, the co-owner of Leather Spa, says craftsmanship also plays a part in the shoes' high price tag. His company works directly with Louboutin to repair its shoes, repainting and replacing the red soles.

David Mesquita: I mean there's a lot of things that go into the design of a shoe, and the making of a shoe. Most importantly, I think is, who's designing it, who's manufacturing it, and also what materials they're using to make the shoes.

Whether you're talking about feathers, rhinestones, or exotic materials, there's so much attention to detail that they put into their manufacturing and designing of their shoes. Narrator: For instance, these $3,595 Louboutins are embellished with Swarovski Crystals. And these raccoon fur boots cost $1,995. When it all comes down to it, people are paying for the status symbol.

Producer Spencer Alben bought a pair of Louboutins for her wedding.

Spencer Alben: It makes me sound so stuck up, but I love the red soles because it's such like a fashion icon symbol. There's something about them that when you see them in a picture, you instantly know what those are. So it's like a status symbol I guess, which makes me sound terrible.

They were over $1,000, which when I say that now, is insane for one pair of shoes that you're probably never gonna wear again. It's like something that everyone knows, so the second you see the red bottoms, it's like, I know what those are, I know what those cost. And it's so superficial that we care about that, but it really is something that is universal. You see that and you instantly know what those are, and it's something special. So I think, something as silly as the color of the sole on the shoe, makes them so special, because it's universally identifiable.

Narrator: Would you drop $1,000 for red-bottomed shoes?",Manufacturing

What sort of feet can we fit?
Our expertise is in fitting swollen feet. Our footwear isn‚Äôt just extra-wide, it‚Äôs extra deep as well which means it‚Äôs very roomy. It‚Äôs also adjustable so it can fit a range of swelling from minor to very swollen. We can also fit very wide feet, problem toes, bunions, bandaging and orthotics. Lots of thought goes into our shoemaking including carefully placed seams, comfy insoles and cushioned support.",Manufacturing

95,L9Fg4zXN4,How to make shoes basic pattern,"In this shoe making tutorial, I will teach you how to make a basic shoe pattern. From this basic shoe pattern, you will create all other pattern parts of your shoe.
You have one last and, of course, you want to make different shoe models using the same last. How do you usually work? 
What you do is, you attach the masking tape and design your shoes on it, then you check it if you made your masking tape shoe pattern correct. When you want to make new shoe model on this last (as it should be), you do it all over again and then check your masking tape shoe pattern. 
So, each time when you are making a new shoe pattern, you waste valuable time to check your masking tape pattern until you get it right. 

Now I want to ask you, why you should spend your time and effort on the same shoemaking process if you can work smart instead?
Make your basic shoe pattern to work smart 
You can and should work faster and easier with the help of Basic Shoe Pattern.

Before I will explain it, let‚Äôs talk about main mistakes that are the cause of your wrong shoe patterns, whatever your shoe design is.

In most cases, it happens when you are attaching your masking tape pattern to the cardboard. 

Yes, simple as this and you do it wrong! Now, what you need to look for?!


1. You need to attach masking tape pattern at the right angle.
2. You need to spread all wrinkles and folds of masking tape pattern correctly. You need to do it, do not change the correct dimension of your last. Those wrinkles and folds of masking tape always created as a result of transferring masking tape pattern from 3D shape (your shoe last) to 2D shape (the cardboard).

So when you make your basic shoe pattern for different models of shoes, each time you struggle with the same  problems:

* finding the right angle

* spreading all of the folds correctly

 Why should you work this way?
This way you spend so much time on useless tests. This is a just wrong way to work.

That‚Äôs why first you should make the basic pattern of your last. Check it using ordinary paper pattern, to make sure you transferred it in the right angle and spread well all of the folds. Only then you should make another masking tape pattern with the footwear design that you want to make ( second basic pattern).

Just think about it, you will only need to do it right once.

This way you will attach your new design on the already checked first basic shoe pattern with the right angle and will avoid common mistakes that happen during the transfer ( 2D-3D ). The first basic shoe pattern will serve you as a guide to attach each of your new shoe designs made on the same last correctly from the start.

The first basic shoe pattern is a kind of a template for any of your shoe designs that you will want to make. This is how you will spend less time with pattern making and will avoid many mistakes developing different types of shoes. 
I hope I made you think of the process, let me know in the comment if it will change the way you work ( I hope so) on your shoe pattern.

In a previous post, we took a behind-the-scenes look at adidas' latest offering in the form of the Ultra Boost running shoe. Now, in an HYPEBEAST PROCESS video, we get to watch the entire process in the production of the latest sneaker. Despite living in the modern age where nearly everything that is created is done so by autonomous machinery, it's refreshing to see that there is some level of human intervention to produce the polished product. From the complete knitted uppers to boxing the complete pair, this short exploration  in the construction of the Ultra Boost sheds light on the breakdown of the minimal, lightweight running shoe, and the attention to detail implemented by the workers.

Jeans, shoes, t-shirts and everything between heaven and earth are made in workshops where workers are laboring away at an impressive 17 hours a day. 

So what does it look like inside one of these operations? And how are the good produced?

As Vietnam is quite far behind the West in terms of economic development and only begun the process of industrialization a few decades ago, it should come as no surprise that manufacturing here is a highly labor intensive endeavor.

175,nSOt-H2kxmM,How To Make Shoes | Custom Sneakers From The Sole Up,"Have you ever wanted to know how to make shoes? We spend most of our life wearing sneakers so in this video I take you inside of a factory that makes thousands of custom shoes to show you how they‚Äôre made. Start your brand with this free online training‚Üí 

I recently traveled to Leon, Mexico known as the shoe capital of the world in search of discovering how to make shoes. What I observed is that the process of making a custom sneakers is time intensive when it comes to manufacturing. In order to make a custom shoe line from scratch (from the soles to the uppers), it requires weeks of prep time and can take months to complete!

Inside of this video you will find the key steps involved in the shoe making process including:

*Shoe Design & Pattern Making *
The process of designing and creating patterns for a shoe begins by applying tape to a shoe last. The designer will then draw their idea on top of the tape, which is then cut from the last and made into a digital pattern. 

*Sampling The Design*
Once the digital patterns are created they are made into physical patterns which are placed on the desired fabrics for the shoe design. The sample makers than take the cut pieces and make the one off design. Once the shoes are approved, the manufacturing process begins.

*Creating The Shoe Mold*
The shoe mold is designed in a CAD based system which is then made into a physical block with a CNC machine. The CNC machine engraves the design of the shoe sole into a metal block. This metal block is then inspected and prepared for the injection molding process, creating the base for the sneakers, heels and a variety of pieces needed for custom shoe designs. 

*Metallization Process*
Some shoes have pieces that need a metallic finish, and during the metallization process plastic is put into a large vacuum which binds the metal to the plastic components.

*Injection Molding*
Using the shoe mold created with the CNC machine the sole of the shoes are instantly produced inside of the mold injection machine. Allowing thousand of shoe soles to be made every day. 

*Fabric Cutting*
There are two different ways that fabrics for a large sneaker production can be cut; on a laser cutting machine or die cut. A laser cutter is able to cut pieces fairly quickly, but is usually used for runs lower than 5,000 pairs of shoes. Die Cutting is used for larger runs and is more efficient as you can stack multiple layers of fabrics and cut them all at once. 

*Sewing and Completing The Shoe*
A variety of sewing machines, presses and gluing processes are required in the finishing of a shoe. Each shoe design has its own set up involved, and throughout this video we share all of the processes in detail for you to better understand how to make custom shoes.

Traditional handicraft shoemaking has now been largely superseded in volume of shoes produced by industrial mass production of footwear, but not necessarily in quality, attention to detail, or craftsmanship.

Shoemakers or cordwainers (cobblers being, historically, those who repair shoes) may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material, and often consist of multiple parts for better durability of the sole, stitched to a leather upper.

ID: 1532758

Britain‚Äôs last remaining shoe manufacturer is looking to take great strides in post-brexit Britain - eyeing up continued expansion in far-flung markets.

Dennis Crompton and his brother Jon bought are proud owners of Norman Walsh footwear in their hometown of Bolton, Greater Manchester.

They bought the company from its eponymous founder in 1996 after falling in love with his trainers in the 1970s.

Norman, who was selected to make the running shoes worn by Roger Bannister during his four-minute mile attempt, founded Norman Walsh in 1961.

His original designs are still so successful that the firm simply looks through the archives and tweaks them whenever they bring out a new product.

Sherwani shoes are usually identified by their uniqueness of being pointed toe, flat and straight sole that does not show the variation between left and right foot. The designs are very intrinsic and delicate with the precious gems, pearls and precious stone works. They are the perfect outfit that provides an essential ethnic appeal for religious occasions, parties, festivals and weddings.

Following is a transcript of the video:

Narrator: What makes these shoes worth almost $800? Christian Louboutin is the mastermind behind these iconic red-bottomed shoes. It's safe to say his footwear has stepped into the mainstream. Celebrities all over the world wear them.

""You know the ones with the high heels and the red bottoms?""

‚ô™ These expensive, these is red bottoms ‚ô™ ‚ô™ These is bloody shoes ‚ô™

Narrator: Louboutin even had the red bottoms trademarked. The signature Louboutin pumps, start at $695. The most expensive pair, nearly $6,000. So how did this craze start? Christian Louboutin had the idea for red soles in 1993. An employee was painting her nails red. Louboutin snagged the bottle and painted the soles of a prototype shoe. Just like that, the red soles were born.

So, what makes these shoes worth the cost? In 2013, when the New York Times asked Louboutin, why his shoes are so expensive, he blamed production costs. Louboutin said, ""It's expensive to make shoes in Europe."" From 2008 to 2013, he said his company's production costs had doubled as the euro strengthened against the dollar, and competition increased for quality materials from factories in Asia.

David Mesquita, the co-owner of Leather Spa, says craftsmanship also plays a part in the shoes' high price tag. His company works directly with Louboutin to repair its shoes, repainting and replacing the red soles.

David Mesquita: I mean there's a lot of things that go into the design of a shoe, and the making of a shoe. Most importantly, I think is, who's designing it, who's manufacturing it, and also what materials they're using to make the shoes.

Whether you're talking about feathers, rhinestones, or exotic materials, there's so much attention to detail that they put into their manufacturing and designing of their shoes. Narrator: For instance, these $3,595 Louboutins are embellished with Swarovski Crystals. And these raccoon fur boots cost $1,995. When it all comes down to it, people are paying for the status symbol.

Producer Spencer Alben bought a pair of Louboutins for her wedding.

Spencer Alben: It makes me sound so stuck up, but I love the red soles because it's such like a fashion icon symbol. There's something about them that when you see them in a picture, you instantly know what those are. So it's like a status symbol I guess, which makes me sound terrible.

They were over $1,000, which when I say that now, is insane for one pair of shoes that you're probably never gonna wear again. It's like something that everyone knows, so the second you see the red bottoms, it's like, I know what those are, I know what those cost. And it's so superficial that we care about that, but it really is something that is universal. You see that and you instantly know what those are, and it's something special. So I think, something as silly as the color of the sole on the shoe, makes them so special, because it's universally identifiable.

Narrator: Would you drop $1,000 for red-bottomed shoes?",Manufacturing

218,L9Fg4zXN4,How to make shoes basic pattern,"In this shoe making tutorial, I will teach you how to make a basic shoe pattern. From this basic shoe pattern, you will create all other pattern parts of your shoe.
You have one last and, of course, you want to make different shoe models using the same last. How do you usually work? 
What you do is, you attach the masking tape and design your shoes on it, then you check it if you made your masking tape shoe pattern correct. When you want to make new shoe model on this last (as it should be), you do it all over again and then check your masking tape shoe pattern. 
So, each time when you are making a new shoe pattern, you waste valuable time to check your masking tape pattern until you get it right. 

Now I want to ask you, why you should spend your time and effort on the same shoemaking process if you can work smart instead?
Make your basic shoe pattern to work smart 
You can and should work faster and easier with the help of Basic Shoe Pattern.

Before I will explain it, let‚Äôs talk about main mistakes that are the cause of your wrong shoe patterns, whatever your shoe design is.

In most cases, it happens when you are attaching your masking tape pattern to the cardboard. 

Yes, simple as this and you do it wrong! Now, what you need to look for?!


1. You need to attach masking tape pattern at the right angle.
2. You need to spread all wrinkles and folds of masking tape pattern correctly. You need to do it, do not change the correct dimension of your last. Those wrinkles and folds of masking tape always created as a result of transferring masking tape pattern from 3D shape (your shoe last) to 2D shape (the cardboard).

So when you make your basic shoe pattern for different models of shoes, each time you struggle with the same  problems:

* finding the right angle

* spreading all of the folds correctly

 Why should you work this way?
This way you spend so much time on useless tests. This is a just wrong way to work.

That‚Äôs why first you should make the basic pattern of your last. Check it using ordinary paper pattern, to make sure you transferred it in the right angle and spread well all of the folds. Only then you should make another masking tape pattern with the footwear design that you want to make ( second basic pattern).

Just think about it, you will only need to do it right once.

This way you will attach your new design on the already checked first basic shoe pattern with the right angle and will avoid common mistakes that happen during the transfer ( 2D-3D ). The first basic shoe pattern will serve you as a guide to attach each of your new shoe designs made on the same last correctly from the start.

The first basic shoe pattern is a kind of a template for any of your shoe designs that you will want to make. This is how you will spend less time with pattern making and will avoid many mistakes developing different types of shoes. 
I hope I made you think of the process, let me know in the comment if it will change the way you work ( I hope so) on your shoe pattern.

At Shoe Plaza,  a shoe factory in Aba, thousands of Nigerians transform basic raw materials into impressive footwear. 

Shoe Plaza produces over 30,000 pairs of slippers weekly. It takes them 3 to 5 days to finish building pair of shoes, but slippers are done within a day. 

One of the guys rocking the shoe factory in Aba is Paul Andras Chidieber. He is an Information Technology student at Federal University Owerri (FUTO).

Paul Andrasm a current FUTO undergraduates started learning at shoe factory in Aba in 2013, during ASUU strike under ex-President Goodluck Jonathan.

Paul Andras makes close to N40,000 weekly makings shoes at the shoe factory in Aba. 

Paul Andras has registered with NIIT to learn Java and Python in order to advance in his IT career. He also has plan to learn Computer Networking so he can go for his Maters degree in United States or India.

Made in Nigeria Products has an image problem, samething with Made in Aba shoes.

We Nigerians look down on Made in Nigeria Products as we consider folks who wear Made in Aba shoes to be poor. 

But, the truth is some of the Prada and designers shoes 'rich' Nigerians wear are Made in Aba. 

Maybe if we start appreciating Made in Nigeria Products, Shoe Factory in Aba, among other great things made locally can get better in quality and make us proud.
