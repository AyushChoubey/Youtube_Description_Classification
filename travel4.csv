We did it. We quit our jobs, moved out of our apartment, sold all our belongings and left Dubai and the United Arab Emirates, and off to the USA we went for our Great American Road Trip, the first part of our 8-month trip around the world. 

For the first leg of our big adventure, we started with a 3 week-long Epic West Coast USA road trip and tried to hit all of the US National Parks we could.

After our direct flight from DXB to Seattle with Emirates, and more than 14 hours in the air - which honestly, wasn’t enough to catch up on all the movies/series Emirates' ICE offers! - , we landed in Seattle Airport and went to pick up our trusty car at Hertz.

The Emirates direct flight from Dubai to Seattle is a dream because it leaves Dubai at 8:35am and lands in Seattle at 10:55am the same day, wasting no time and allowing for a good nights sleep before exploring all you can in the US. 

We had no idea that Emirates flew this route but were thankful to find it as it proved to be the perfect launching city from which to start a great American road trip - and the stunning nature, ocean, and scenery was the perfect beginning to our amazing adventure down the west coast of the USA. 

Now that we'd sorted the flight and arrived to Seattle, we had to find our home for the next three weeks - time to get our rental car!

Since we registered in advance for the Hertz Gold Plus Rewards loyalty programme, we didn’t have to queue and could directly select our car on the spot at the airport in Seattle - with an additional driver for free!  This was a huge benefit after a long flight and allowed us to get right on the road. It's the little things like this that make such a huge difference on a trip like this.

Tip: Register for the Hertz Gold Plus loyalty programme to benefit from awesome features too!

Seattle, Washington
Once we picked up our car, we headed directly towards Seattle city center for a quick visit to Pike’s Market on Elliott Bay, one of the oldest in the USA, where you can find fresh produce, independent businesses, the most amazing seafood in the US, and specialty foods.

We then had to stop for a coffee at the world’s oldest operating Starbucks on Pike Place, a classic! (we're so white...)

After this quick visit to Seattle, we had to continue towards Portland, where we spent the first two nights of our West Coast USA road trip - in one of the funkiest cities in America.

Portland, Oregon
We woke up early on the second day (thanks, jet lag!) and went for a morning workout in Forest Park, which ended up being absolutely beautiful and we finally could breathe real oxygen and see greenery and trees, which we missed so much living in the desert for so many years! Forest Park is the largest urban park in the US and goes on forever with endless amazing hikes and trails.

After a lunch at Whole Foods (you know it), we visited Powell’s Books, the oldest independent bookstore in the world. We could have stayed for hours - the bookstore is huge, has all genres imaginable and is such a cozy place!

Crater Lake, Oregon
On the way from Oregon to California, we made a stop at Crater Lake, and we’re thrilled we did! Upon entering the Crater Lake National Park, we bought the $80 America the Beautiful pass, which allows you unlimited entry to all National Parks in the USA for a year - super worth it if you’re doing a West Coast USARoad Trip as each individual National Park pass is around $20-$30.

Redwood National Park, California
While driving down from Oregon into California, we stopped by Redwood National Park, as Jeff had never visited - even though he lived in California for years! 

San Francisco, California
This was our second time in San Francisco together, and we decided to start a 5k run on the Golden Gate bridge to kick-start the day! What a feeling, to be on one of the (if not THE most) iconic bridges in the world, running and feeling great!

Los Angeles, California
Los Angeles is difficult to cover in a few days as it’s so massive and spread out. We managed to see a lot of Jeff’s friends, do some amazing hikes to Griffith Observatory and up Mount Hollywood and even watch a Dodgers baseball game (I am yet to fully understand the game, but it was an incredible experience with an unparalleled atmosphere!).

Las Vegas, Nevada
We made a quick detour by Las Vegas, since I had never been. We stayed right on the strip in the Treasure Island hotel...

21,21,7ISrhzpTnmM,Arizona (USA) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"✱ 2.380 Hotels in Arizona - Lowest Price Guarantee ► https://booki.ng/2SIZI4b

Travel video about destination Arizona in the USA.
Arizona, land of cowboys and Indians and Wild West towns plus, among its many natural wonders, the all pervasive colour red as displayed by the awe-inspiring rock formations of its mighty canyons.A thousand years ago the highly-cultured Anasazi and Hohokam Indians lived here, planting maize and vegetables in the meagre valleys and building walled towns into the cliffs of the canyons. They used the natural environment, protected caves in natural rock walls, which were accessible only by simple wooden ladders. For the past century, scientists from all over the world have investigated evidence that a gigantic meteorite crashed here, leaving behind it a huge crater: Meteor Crater. As the central and inner walls of the crater are similar to the landscape of the moon, preparation and training for the APOLLO space missions took place here. Located in North West Arizona is the 378 square kilometre National Park known as the ‘Petrified Forest’ with a surrounding desert which shimmers in all the colours of the rainbow. There’s the Agate Bridge, a huge fossilised tree trunk which spans twelve metres wide across a gorge and the amazingly beautiful Canyon De Chelly. Situated in the Navajo Indian Reservation, the Betatakin Ruins are the remains of historical dwellings which were carved into the rock by their original inhabitants from the 13th Century B.C. Wild West fans instantly recognise Monument Valley where, between colossal, 300 metre tall monoliths and sky-high rocky needles, John Wayne and countless other screen heroes fought off Indians and battled with ‘baddies’. A natural sculpture formed from undulating waves of stone, Antelope Canyon is a palette of colour which teases the eye. From the surface, a gaping crevice is the only means of access, tempting the curious to enter. In bold contrast, the Grand Canyon is 1,600 metres deep and 16 kilometres long, the most colossal gorge in the world. The sight of this gigantic natural wonder is the exciting climax of any trip to the magnificent and majestic land of Arizona.

25,25,WND2wx5S4t8,25 Beautiful Places In The United States You Need To Visit Today,"There are a lot of Americans who are fascinated with traveling to Europe. Can you blame them, Europe is beautiful with a rich history and stunning old architecture. HOWEVER (and that’s a big however), the United States is home to extraordinary beauty as well. What it lacks in the historical/cultural department (compared to Europe) it more than makes up with its diverse and stunning natural beauty. From the beaches of Florida and the deserts of Arizona to the rugged peaks of California and the rain forests of Hawaii, there is hardly anything you cannot find in the United States. So if you are itching for travel, consider a trip around America. In fact, we humbly suggest you check out these 25 Beautiful Places In The United States You Need To Visit Today.

Travel video about destination USA - The West.
The west of North America is full of amazing contrast and stretches from the pretentious world of the Hollywood glitterati to a landscape that is both natural and spectacular. This journey features some unique and impressive sights such as the historic rock settlements of the Native American Indians and fascinating salt deserts and volcanic areas.Los Angeles is synonymous with Hollywood and it was here that this amazing city attained worldwide fame. The Sidewalk Of Fame is covered with brass stars that bear the names of famous celebrities of both past and present. Universal Studios is the largest and most active film and television studio in the world as well as providing a popular day out for the family and is one of the most successful amusement parks in the U.S.A. Death Valley covers an area of around ten thousand square kilometres. Around a fifth of the region is located at or below sea-level. During the gold rush of the nineteenth century it was through here that thousands of pioneers took a short cut while journeying west. They eventually arrived in a valley that offered no further way forward. Weakness, hunger and lack of water combined to create the name of this treacherous valley. Las Vegas is like a mirage in the desert, awake day and night it is THE entertainment capital of the world. The Bellagio is a return to the exclusive nature of the casino hotels of the past in which luxury is at its zenith and an investment of nearly two billion dollars speaks for itself. Sixteen hundred metres deep and sixteen kilometres long the Grand Canyon is the most colossal gorge in the world. The sight of this gigantic natural wonder is the climax of any trip to Arizona and each year around five million visitors come to see this, the ‘Eighth Wonder Of The World’. Natural wonders, amazing sights, boundless wealth and incredible neon: America’s west still has the call of the wild!

BLOG POSTS ABOUT MY TRIP TO THE US: 

——

I took a trip to the US last summer and it was undoubtedly the best trip I’d ever been on. I wasn’t a YouTuber back then and wasn’t too big on taking videos, but I still managed to take quite a few videos during the trip and thought I’d try editing a nice video out of it.

I really enjoyed editing it even though I wish I’d taken more and better quality videos. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy watching this! If you did then don't forget to like, share and subscribe! :)

30,30,fOAwDm4cfJk,15 Magical Places in America,"The United States of America are home to countless beautiful landscapes and natural wonders so it’s hard and almost unfair to choose only 15 Magical Places. Nevertheless, we decided to put together a completely subjective list of places that left us completely speechless. Life is short, so make sure to include one of this beauties in your next trip.

Subscribe to American Eye 



#5 Northern Lights, Alaska
 
The best place on Earth to experience the magnificence of the northern lights is definitely Alaska. Head to Fairbanks between late August and April, sit back in a heated ""aurorium"" cabin or simply walk outside and look up to the sky. Aurora borealis or The Northern Lights are the results of collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun’s atmosphere and gaseous particles from Earth's atmosphere. They occur 60 miles above the Earth, making a colorful display of brilliant yellow-green and sometimes even red- purple patterns.



#4 The Wave, Arizona
 
The Wave is a sandstone formation located in Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness. In order to maintain the natural integrity only 20 people per day are allowed to visit The Wave. For that,  you will need a day-use permit that you have to get up to 4 months in advance in an on- line lottery, or by lottery the day before visiting. There are no marked trails or signs to guide hikers that have to be prepared also for fierce winds, harsh desert conditions and blowing sand. You ask: Is all that hassle worth it? Definitely yes. Here you can create the most wonderful Instagram- worthy photos that need no filter.


#3 Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida
 
Florida is without a doubt one of the most beautiful US states. Here in the Sunshine State, you have The Dry Tortugas National Park, located only 68 miles west of Key West. You can get there by ferry or seaplane from Key West. The park consists of small archipelago of seven coral islands and Fort Jefferson, a massive yet unfinished fortress made from 16 million bricks. Here you can find abundant sea life, coral reefs, and sunken treasures. 



#2 Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
 
The sacred place for Hawaiians is also the most active volcano on Earth. The Kilauea volcano is sometimes called, ""the world's only drive-in volcano."" It produces 250,000-650,000 cubic yards of lava on daily basis ever since January 3rd, 1983. You can take a hike through volcanic craters and watch blistering lava flows meet the sea.




#1 Maroon Bells, Colorado
 
Just 10 miles from Aspen, Colorado you have the most photographed mountains in the USA. Unmatched mountain scenery created by two peaks in the Elk Mountains called the Maroon Bells and the reflective lake. It took more than 300 million years of sedimentation and erosion to create the Maroon Valley, a natural wonder that truly encapsulates the beauty of the Rocky Mountains.",travel

32,32,4JogwZcM0I,Hawaii (USA) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"✱ 4.944 Hotels in Hawaii - Lowest Price Guarantee ► https://booki.ng/2tlEKtD

Travel video about destination Hawaii.
The Hawaiian Islands are located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and form the 50th state of the USA. In the south east of the island of O’Ahu, Honolulu is a modern town and the starting point for most journeys. It also contains the Iolani Palace - once the residence of King David Kalakana -a magnificent Victorian structure in the centre of Honolulu and the only royal palace in the United States. In Pearl Harbour, a museum commemorates the events of the seventh of December 1941 when most of the American Pacific fleet was destroyed by the Japanese. The valley of Nuuanu Pali is of great importance in Hawaiian history. It was here that a deciding battle took place, when King Kamehameh came from Maui and triumphantly drove the troops of the chief of Oahu into the mountains, the result of which formed the political union of the Hawaiian Islands. In winter, the world’s best surfers collect on Sunset Beach, attracted by spectacular waves, some of which reach as high as the tallest church steeples. On the island of Kaua’i, the Wailua is Hawaii’s only navigable river and it flows through some of the exciting locations which were used for Jurassic Park, Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Blue Hawaii. Two volcanoes dominate the extraordinary island of Maui, which also features sandy beaches, green pastures, dense jungle and a bleak lunar-like landscape. On Waimea Beach in 1778, the English sea captain, James Cook, was the first European to set foot on Hawaiian territory. The Waimea Canyon was referred to by Mark Twain as ‘The Grand Canyon of the Pacific’, a massive gorge which has been carved out of the volcanic landscape by the Waimea River. From a Victorian style station there is the narrow-gauge Sugar Cane Train which travels through the once prolific sugar plantations of Kaanapali. Haleakale is the world’s largest dormant volcano with a crater as large as Manhattan. But nowhere else in the world can volcanoes be studied as safely as on Big Island in the Hawaiian Volcanoes National Park The Hawaiian Islands…priceless pearls in the Pacific Ocean.

Originally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug! We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling! So we extended our 1 year trip to now FOUR years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

ABOUT:

Travel has changed my life and I have no plans on stopping any time soon.

That's why I am now running this video blog showing you how to travel the world continuously

FAQ:

How did you learn to edit?
I taught myself. I downloaded Premiere Pro and began to figure out how to use it through trial and error. My videos were pretty bad at first but eventually, and with the help of many tutorials, you start to figure out what works. 

Premiere Pro Link: 

What work are you doing?
I started off running this video blog while doing freelance web design and video editing to supplement my travelling lifestyle. I now rely solely on this blog to generate revenue through advertising, affiliate links and sponsorship opportunities. 

How do you meet the people in your videos?
Hostels, guesthouses and conversations! You meet people so easily while travelling. Just open yourself up and you will meet all sorts of amazing people.
'
Where do you live?
Right now, I travel the world continuously and so do not have a permanent base or home anywhere. I am not sure how long this is going to be the situation but right now I just want to keep travelling.

66,66,0oXcVtvzFqg,"Travel in Portland, USA","Travel in Portland with Macca and Brianna as they visit one of the hippest cities in all of the United States. With an amazing craft beer scene and an awesome nightlife, there's also some incredibly weird things to do in the city too. And when we say weird, we mean really really weird. We're sure you'll quickly find out what we mean...

If you enjoyed our alternative take on travel in Portland, check out A Brit and a Broad to see what else we go up to -  - and subscribe for more videos like this one - 

✈✈✈

Portland, Oregon, is without a doubt one of the hippest cities in the United States. 

With a highly active art scene, more craft breweries than you'll know what to do with, and some freakin' weird things to see and do too, Portland is one of the hottest places to be in right now. Add in those chilled vibes of the Pacific Northwest and it's become a hipsters haven and a desirable destination for tourists, so we just had to check it out for ourselves.

In this episode we explore the weird and the wonderful in all Portland has to offer. From the freaky Peculiarium museum with a giant 10ft Sasquatch to the 2ft tiny world's smallest park, we did it all.

In between all the craft breweries there's the food truck district to explore with a million different cuisines to choose from, and we had to go back in time at Ground Kontrol, the 90's arcade where we felt like big kids again.

And of course, we couldn't come to Portland without having a night out on the tiles. With an array of amazing bars and clubs to choose from, this city completely changes once it goes from daylight to dusk. 

Portland is a city that prides itself on its own kookiness, and it doesn’t look like that's going to change any time soon. As they say, ""keep weird, Portland"".

68,68,LCtTNzpk0g,Things to do in Nevada Travel Guide | USA Road Trip 2017,"Join us as we visit Nevada state covering attractions outside of Las Vegas on a USA road trip of a lifetime focusing on outdoor adventures in our things to do in Nevada travel guide. As many know tourism in Nevada is often focused around a trip to Las Vegas; however, what many may not know is that the state of Nevada features a plethora of National Parks, fascinating highways and roadside attractions worth visiting.

Things to do in Nevada Travel Guide | USA Road Trip 2017 Video Transcript:

Our trip began in Las Vegas, but having already been there before, we wasted no time on the Strip. After a short night’s rest, we grabbed a hearty breakfast, hopped in our rental car, and hit the road for our first stop of the day: Lake Mead.

Hoover Dam is one of the most visited attractions in Nevada with as many as 1 million people taking the tour every year, and even more driving across the dam. 

Fun fact: there is enough concrete in Hoover Dam to build a 4 foot wide sidewalk around the Earth at the Equator. That’s a whole lot of concrete!

Kayaking in Black Canyon was the highlight of the day. We lucked out with blue skies, calm waters, and the scenery was pretty spectacular - especially once we entered the canyon.

Halfway up stream we took a break from kayaking and went on a short hike. 

We also stopped at the Emerald Cave, which gets it’s name from the bright emerald green colour reflected in the water.

We had an hour’s journey to reach the Valley of Fire that morning, and it was a very leisurely drive down some scenic stretches of road. We knew we were getting closer to the park when we noticed the landscape colours started becoming more saturated. 

Once we entered Valley of Fire State Park, the fun began. This park is known for its rock formations, panoramic vistas, and hiking trails, so there was no shortage of things to see and do. 

Back on the road, we hit our first stop on the ET Highway: ET Fresh Jerky! This is an alien-themed shop selling everything from martian soda to alien sunglasses, so we used this as an opportunity to load up on snacks. 

After stopping for photos at the ET Highway marker which is covered in stickers, we journeyed on to the Alien Research Centre, which is pretty hard to miss considering they have a giant metal alien standing guard on a hill. 

Out front, we spotted a UFO-towing pick-up truck and a green alien welcoming earthlings, while inside we were surrounded by Area 51 warning signs and all sorts of alien-themed souvenirs. 

And then it was time to turn around, drive back to Vegas, and fly back home,.

A surprise addition to our Nevada travel guide was visiting Red Rock Canyon, which is just a 20-minute drive from the Vegas Strip. 

Our final thoughts? There are way more things to do in Nevada than just Las Vegas and we’re glad we got to experience a mix of nature and quirky attractions on this mini USA road trip! If you have any other suggestions of cool things to see and do around the state, feel free to leave your recommendations in the comments below.

Travel video about nature park Yellowstone National Park in the USA.
Located in the northwest of the U.S.A., in the state of Wyoming, is Yellowstone, a national park of the superlative, in which the impressive white water of Old Faithful is today one of the most famous and most photographed natural spectacles in the world. Indeed, for more than a century, this mighty geyser has been the proud and unique landmark of the oldest national park in the United States.

The Yellowstone National Park is famous for its highly visible geological processes. The area close to Old Faithful not only features a number of geysers but also numerous hot springs that highlight the tremendous thermal power that lies beneath the earth's surface.

Today, the Grand Geyser is the largest active geyser in the world. Its huge eruptions occur every 8 to 14 hours and last for 9 to 12 minutes and can sometimes reach a height of 60 metres.

The Yellowstone is one of the largest volcanoes in the world. Because it is located directly above a geological hot spot, a huge cave constantly fills with magma. It is situated at a depth of 8 kilometres and is the reason for the park's visible geothermal activity.

Some kilometres south of Nymph Lake is another geothermal area, the Norris Geyser Basin. This area is unique among the landscapes of Yellowstone Park as it is not only the park's hottest area but also boasts the largest geyser in the world, Steamboat Geyser.

Although Yellowstone National Park is important for North America's plant and wild life, this 9,000 square kilometre nature reserve is primarily a geological park.

Amazing, fantastic, incredible and wonderful.  How can you put into words a place that provides so many remarkable glimpses of the inner workings of Planet Earth?

Welcome to Seattle, a city that straddles the modern world and the natural one.

While it’s known for its overcast weather, when the sun comes out in Seattle, you’re in for the perfect photo op, where blue skies and calm seas surround classic architecture and striking modern buildings. Take in a view of the city from the Observation Deck of Smith Tower, then head down to the waterfront for incredible seafood and harbor cruises.

Visit the world-famous Pike Place Market, home to fresh catches, local produce, and yes, the world’s first Starbucks®. From there, explore the great outdoors at Woodland Park Zoo, full of recreated savannahs and tropical rainforests. If you’re still craving more natural wonders, go to Olympic National Park a few hours away and meander through its scenic, wooded beauty.

Round out your Seattle sightseeing with Ruby Beach and pick your way through the driftwood scattered across the shore. Look out to the ocean, watch the sunset, and know you’re in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

87,87,NkrrL9VHC9Q,Guaranteed USA Visit Visa| Guaranteed USA Tourist Visa| 100 % Success Ratio|,"United States of America is a favorite destination for travelers around the world, including Pakistani travelers. More than a million Pakistani expats live and work in US. If you want to visit your family or friends in USA or want to go as a tourist than the information is given here.
If you are visiting US on a visit visa or business visa in 2019, and looking forward to get information about the US visa requirements and application process, US visa fees, documents requirements and processing time than you are at the right place. The whole process is given below.
The B-1/B-2 visitor visa is for people traveling to the United States temporarily for business (B-1) or for pleasure or medical treatment (B-2). Generally, the B-1 visa is for travelers consulting with business associates, attending scientific, educational, professional or business conventions/conferences, settling an estate or negotiating contracts. The B-2 visa is for travel that is recreational in nature, including tourism, visits with friends or relatives, medical treatment and activities of a fraternal, social or service nature. Often, the B-1 and B-2 visas are combined and issued as one visa: the B-1/B-2.

Often, the B-1 and B-2 visas are combined and issued as one visa: the B-1/B-2.
If you apply for a B-1/B-2 visa, you must demonstrate to a consular officer that you qualify for a U.S. visa in accordance with the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Section 214(b) of the INA presumes that every B-1/B-2 applicant is an intending immigrant. You must overcome this legal presumption by showing:
• That the purpose of your trip to the United States is for a temporary visit, such as business, pleasure, or medical treatment
• That you plan to remain in the United States for a specific, limited period of time
• Evidence of funds to cover your expenses while in the United States
• That you have a residence outside the United States, as well as other binding social or economic ties, that will ensure your return abroad at the end of your visit",travel

100,100,6M3NhaSArZk,Las Vegas (USA) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"✱ 474 Hotels in Las Vegas - Lowest Price Guarantee ► https://booki.ng/2X5b2XJ

Travel video about destination Las Vegas in the United States of America.
A fascinating glimpse into the non-stop entertainment capital of the world, Las Vegas, that offers a great deal more than the gambling casinos for which it's famous.

There's the Luxor Hotel that was built at a cost of 400 million dollars and contains 2,526 rooms and an atrium that can accommodate nine jumbo jets. This is in stark contrast to the Excalibur Hotel that evokes King Arthur and his Round Table.

Even the New York skyline is on full view and features Greenwich Village, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Statue of Liberty and a screeching roller-coaster ride above the residential quarters of New York!

The exclusive Romanesque Caesar's Palace contains some of the finest and most elegant shops in the United States that epitomize the height of luxury.

The Mirage Hotel boasts an erupting volcano and cascading waterfalls.

The Venetian is the world's largest hotel with more than 6,600 spacious suites and a gondolier is on hand to transport visitors through a watery shopping mall as he graces them with an Italian love song.

Las Vegas, there's a lot more to it than this, including Treasure Island and regular battles between pirates and the English fleet. This city is like a huge multi-billion dollar film set where illusion and entertainment know no bounds.

Welcome to Seattle, a city that straddles the modern world and the natural one.

While it’s known for its overcast weather, when the sun comes out in Seattle, you’re in for the perfect photo op, where blue skies and calm seas surround classic architecture and striking modern buildings. Take in a view of the city from the Observation Deck of Smith Tower, then head down to the waterfront for incredible seafood and harbor cruises.

Visit the world-famous Pike Place Market, home to fresh catches, local produce, and yes, the world’s first Starbucks®. From there, explore the great outdoors at Woodland Park Zoo, full of recreated savannahs and tropical rainforests. If you’re still craving more natural wonders, go to Olympic National Park a few hours away and meander through its scenic, wooded beauty.

Round out your Seattle sightseeing with Ruby Beach and pick your way through the driftwood scattered across the shore. Look out to the ocean, watch the sunset, and know you’re in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

Visit our Seattle travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

It stands at an elevation of 26 feet (8 m) above sea level,[8] on a land area of 8.466 sq mi (21.93 km2). The 2010 census recorded a population of 27,810.

Monterey was the capital of Alta California under both Spain and Mexico. It was the only port of entry for taxable goods in California. In 1846, the U.S. flag was raised over the Customs House, and California became part of the United States after the Mexican–American War.

The city had California's first theater, public building, public library, publicly funded school, printing press, and newspaper. The city and surrounding area have attracted artists since the late 19th century and many celebrated painters and writers have lived there. Until the 1950s, there was an abundant fishery.

Among Monterey's notable present-day attractions are the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Cannery Row, Fisherman's Wharf and the annual Monterey Jazz Festival.",travel
105,105,im6hd3VXhg,Rocky Mountain (USA) National Park Travel Guide,"Travel video about destination Rocky Mountain in The USA. 
No other mountains in the United States of America conjure up the myths and legends of the Wild West than do the Rocky Mountains. The Rocky Mountains National Park contains only a small area of North America’s mighty, thousand kilometre long mountain range. It is located in Colorado and rightly deserves its reputation as being one of the greatest natural paradises in the U.S.A.In late spring the vast ocean of flowers that cloaks the meadows is in stark contrast to the snow covered mountain peaks. In the deeper regions the landscape is mostly covered by dense forests that are dominated by many varieties of pine tree. Powerful forces are always at work creating new scenes of natural splendour and in spring time after the snow has melted the creeks are transformed into mighty torrents of water. The combination of high mountains, dense forest, crystal clear lakes, wild rivers and idyllic valleys gives this region a unique atmosphere. The Rocky Mountains National Park is beyond doubt one of the most spectacular and outstanding areas of natural beauty anywhere in the world.

106,106,_mpQ7JJyK2,New York (USA) Vacation Travel Video Guide • Great Destinations,"✱ 1.122 Hotels in New York - Lowest Price Guarantee ► https://booki.ng/2Bz7K5E

New York, the Big Apple for the locals, is the largest city of the United States. Its most famous sight is the monumental Statue of Liberty, but there are the famous skyscrapers like the Empire State Building or the Rockefeller Center, while the twin towers of the World trade Center are sadly missed. Along the streets cabs hunt for customers. The lung of the city is Central Park, the paradise of joggers and dog owners. The Wall Street is the center of the world of money, while the Broadway is the same for Arts. Famous theatres, museums, the cafes and clubs of Greenwich Village and the renewed places of the old docks await the visitors here.

109,109,YWFiinLbdY,Louisiana Swamps (USA) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Lousiana Swamps in The USA. 
In the southern region of Louisiana there is a fascinating and mysterious swampland that was once the sole domain of courageous hunters and trappers. Following the construction of several large dams and water barriers that were designed to defend against catastrophic floods in the extensive delta region, a large network of smaller canals, or 'bayous', was created. Today the Louisiana swamps provide a unique habitat for both indigenous and migratory wildlife and a natural refuge far away from civilisation. Some time ago it was the mink that attracted great hordes of trappers to this region that also served as a hiding place for various bandits and pirates. The desolation of the swamps was well appreciated by those who attempted to escape from the law and they certainly possess an eerie atmosphere. However, the colourful stories of n'er do well's and legendary figures such as Bigfoot have added to the enigmatic character of this intriguing area. Thus from year to year the fascination in the Louisiana swamps continues to captivate an increasing number of visitors.

There are few places in the United States that provide such a deep and fascinating insight into geology as does the Yellowstone National Park that is not only known for its volcanic activity but also for its many magnificent waterfalls and wild rivers. The Sinter Terraces of Mammoth Hot Springs are full of lime and other minerals that have created several constantly growing terraces from the resultant sediment and in the shallow basins between the steps of the terraces there are also various algae and bacteria that are responsible for the brilliant colours of the rocks. The development and formation of the park's landscape is subject to constant change as the hot springs within the earth provide a constant source of energy. The Yellowstone National park is far more than just a land of geysers: its almost nine thousand square kilometres are one of the most remarkable regions on the North American Continent.

114,114,jT7sSXgcI,Summer in New York City | USA Travel Diary,"I spent all of June 2018 soaking up summer in New York City. My third visit to the Big Apple included surprise concerts in the subway, pounding the pavement between Broadway shows, rowing boats in Central Park and sheltering in the shade of the West Village. To me, the city is never more exciting than in summer - the sun sparkles on skyscrapers, the nights are warm and the possibilities feel endless.

121,121,QjpL73rVf60,Everglades National Park Travel South Florida USA Video Guide,"In southern Florida there is a unique world of water, swampland and dense jungle-like forest: the Everglades, a truly magical environment full of mystery, myth and fascinating nature. For many centuries this huge swamp area was inhabited by the Seminole Indians and today the Everglades are one of the greatest natural attractions in the U.S.A. Unlike the somewhat daunting appearance of the alligator the surroundings here are far more benign. The pink flamingo has for many years been associated with Florida and everywhere the croaking of frogs fills the air.  There is a huge variety of birdlife as the vast areas of swampland are an ideal habitat and the water is not only rich in fish, various predators can also be found in large numbers. A total of six hundred species of fish live in the waters of the Everglades and in the summer months when the water level is particularly high there are huge shoals of fish to be found but in the dry months of winter they travel to deeper waters. The alligator is the indisputed king of these marshlands and no other creature is as powerful. We don’t only intend to observe the alligators from the shoreline, we also want to see them from within the water.  They’re everywhere!  Because of their valuable skin they were once almost exterminated. It is a fallacy that the alligator is a bloodthirsty, murderous creature as, unprovoked, this primeval reptile is almost indifferent to our presence and even from a close distance it remains perfectly calm. Despite all the recent encroachment by Man, the world of the alligator has retained much of its mysterious and magical aura and the allure of this unique region still continues to impress in a very remarkable way.

123,123,_IIz0HrNx1U,SANTA FE RAILROAD 1950s WESTERN USA TRAVEL FILM 46004,"Support Our Channel : https://www.patreon.com/PeriscopeFilm

The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company presents “Along the Santa Fe Trail,” a 1950s-era color film promoting travel by train. The film opens with a colorful array of travel brochures and schedules spread across a table at mark  before offering a montage of potential destinations across the United States — from snowcapped to beaches, from bustling urban areas to wide open spaces, from factories to farmland — there are “twin bands of steel” that carry the “lifeblood of America” across the country as a train is shown speeding down the track at mark . No matter where the viewer wishes to visit on vacation, the narrator explains (near mark ) that there is probably a Santa Fe ticket office nearby to help get them there, as the scene carries the viewer inside one typical office and “Mr. Ticketman” offers a “charming lady” some destination choices. To get there, a passenger has a choice of trains from the company’s diesel-powered fleet, including the Golden Gate train which serves the West Coast or El Capitan which offers service between Chicago and Los Angeles. The San Diegan takes travels from Los Angeles to San Diego several times daily, while the Grand Canyon Limited and Texas Chief, the Chief, and the Super Chief offers various cross-country options. Mark  takes the viewer onboard one of Santa Fe’s lounge and dining cars as the narrator explains the various amenities provided to the weary traveler. “There is a train and an accommodation for your every comfort,” he reminds the viewer at mark .

The film continues by taking its viewer to some scenic locales, focusing on Native Americans of the desert Southwest and northern New Mexico, in addition to parks and national monuments such as the Painted Desert or Petrified Forest National Park in northern Arizona (introduced at mark ). Those locations are followed by scenes at Carlsbad Caverns and then to the hustle of Denver (at mark ) — “the metropolis of the Rocky Mountain empire” — as well as Colorado Springs. From there we visit Phoenix, the Rainbow Bridge National Monument in Page, Arizona (mark ), and Aztec ruins before visiting the awe-inspiring sites of Monument Valley at mark  and Grand Canyon at mark . Yosemite National Park is visited at mark , as the film continues to show the viewer a variety of natural wonders, including the warm beaches and other tourist spots of Southern California (shown starting at mark ). Pasadena’s Tournament of Roses Parade takes center stage in the film beginning at mark , followed by a visit to Hollywood (mark ), as we see Hollywood Boulevard and the Hollywood Bowl, and visit the stars’ homes in nearby Palm Springs while saying hello to child star Jackie “Butch” Jenkins at mark .The film ends with a look at the Intertribal Indian Festival in Gallup, New Mexico, starting at mark .

We encourage viewers to add comments and, especially, to provide additional information about our videos by adding a comment!  See something interesting?  Tell people what it is and what they can see by writing something for example: ""01:00:12:00 -- President Roosevelt is seen meeting with Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference.""

There are few places on Earth that highlight the power of nature or are as impressive as the truly awesome Grand Canyon. Millions of years ago erosion and the relentless power of the Colorado River created its magnificent landscape and even today the river continues to force its way through the rock, sand and mud of Canyon. The Canyon extends for four hundred kilometres and its width ranges from between six and thirty kilometres. In 1919 the American government designated the region as a protected area. The first to discover the canyons were the Anasazi Indians who settled in the area around a thousand years ago. They hunted for food and also cultivated corn, pumpkins and beans in many of the neighbouring valleys. Even today a small Indian tribe lives in a nearby canyon. Words alone cannot describe the incredible landscape with its ever-changing colours and fascinating rock walls as the final rays of the setting sun disappear below the horizon until darkness falls in the majestic world of the Grand Canyon.

144,144,IFRA9Srk930,TOP 10 DON’TS WHEN CROSSING THE US AND CANADA BORDER,"416-962-2623 / 1-866-760-2623
www.immigroup.com
http://www.immigroup.com/news/border-...


TOP 10 DON’TS WHEN CROSSING THE US AND CANADA BORDER 

1. SHUT UP! PART 1.DON’T TRY TO BE FUNNY.
Border guards are not your friends, and it’s highly unlikely that they moonlight as talent scouts for comedy clubs. This is the wrong moment to make a buddy or tell jokes. Stay respectful and succinct and save the complaints for the drive away from the checkpoint.
2. SHUT UP! PART 2. DON’T DISCLOSE MORE THAN YOU’RE ASKED.
Answer all of the guard’s questions, but avoid getting chatty about your plans if you don’t have to. Thinking of catching up on some work on your laptop a little during your vacation, for example? Don’t mention that. There is no such thing as an American working holiday visa, although there are plenty of options for working holidays in Canada, or for Canadians travelling to other parts of the world. If you’re going to the U.S, however, best to say that your laptop is just for fantasy sports and YouTube. Planning a trip to propose to your girlfriend? Congratulations. But...   
3. EVEN YOUR SEX LIFE MATTERS.DON’T MENTION THAT YOU’RE PLANNING TO MARRY A CITIZEN OR RESIDENT OF ANOTHER COUNTRY WHEN YOU’RE ENTERING IT. 
Even if you’re in the middle of the appropriate application process, talking about your romantic attachments will not warm the hearts of the border guards and it will get you flagged as a potential risk for illegal immigration. This goes for crossing the US and Canadian border in either direction. Say that you’re visiting “a friend” and save the flaunting of your ring for the day when you’re married or your citizenship and residency information is fully settled. 
4. DEVELOP A “CREATIVE VOCABULARY.”DON’T BE IN A RUSH TO EXPLAIN EVERY DETAIL ABOUT THE GOODS YOU’RE BRINGING WITH YOU, BUT KNOW THE RISKS OF INCOMPLETE DISCLOSURE 
It can be mighty tempting to try to bring a few extra items back from your trip without declaring them. You can push the limits of the personal exemption (see above for the exact amounts), or you can declare the extras and pay the duties. If you’re pushing it, try to describe dollar values using words like “approximately,” “about,” or “around” if you’re just above the personal exemption limits. Remove the tags, and ditch the shopping bags and receipts. If you are searched and the agents find something that you haven’t declared, it’s most likely that you’ll be delayed and that you’ll have to pay the duty. Hey, people forget the things they buy all the time, right? Mistakes can happen.  If you push it too far, however, and you get caught making a false declaration crossing to Canada, you might also have your goods seized or you might have to pay a penalty that’s an extra 25-80% of the goods’ value. The worst case scenario is that you’ll lose the goods permanently and have your vehicle impounded. You’ll also almost certainly find yourself subject to more intense scrutiny at future crossings. Getting caught with small amounts over the limit shouldn’t have lasting repercussions, unless you’re busted repeatedly. Now you know the risks. Govern yourself accordingly. Bonus tip: Never try to conceal anything you just bought at the duty-free shop. They take your name and license plate number and their database is coordinated with the border guards on each side, so lying in this case makes for a guaranteed delay. Don’t do it. 
5. A CRIMINAL MIND, IT’S ALL I’VE EVER KNOWN.DON’T LIE ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL PAST.
If you have run into legal trouble, check to see if it’s serious enough to prevent you from travelling. Each country has its own regulations on this, and most countries reserve the right to deny anyone the right to entry for any reason. If you are denied entry crossing from Canada to US, consider applying for a US Entry Waiver. If you are worried you can’t enter Canada from the US, consider getting a temporary resident permit. The process rules and process for both the US Entry Waiver and the TRP can be complicated and difficult, so you can always seek help.",travel

I decided to travel across the globe just by myself, visit US and work there as a lifeguard. Honestly, it was definitely one of the best decision, I've ever made. I feel very grateful for so many amazing friends I made all over the world and for all those unforgettable memories we made together. 
After almost 3 months my brother with my best friend came to Cedar point, and we started the biggest adventure ever:
Ohio: Sandusky, Illinois: Chicago, Utah: Salt Lake City - Zion park, Arizona: Horseshoe Bend - Grand Canyon - Antelope Canyon, Nevada: Hoover Dam, Las Vegas, California: San Diego - Los Angeles - Santa Barbara - Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks - Yosemite National Park - San Jose - Santa Cruz - San Francisco, New York. ♥ 

So... If you are one of those, who still hesitate and who are not 100% sure: Go! Be scared, but do it anyway. Like I did. Step out of your comfort zone, because that adventure is f**king worthwhile! 🍀 Good luck to all of u guys! World awaits! Don’t listen to what they say. Go see!",travel

154,154,kDijARKw1LQ,How to Travel Journal - USA,"This USA Travel Journal is the newest edition to my travel journal collection! I found these really cute state stickers at Michael's craft store recently and had the idea to create a USA travel journal! Each time we first visit a state, I will create a page with photos and descriptions capturing the memories we made. We have only been to a few states together, so once I get more pages filled up I will show you guys! 
We live in California, so I'm not sure what I'll put on that page...any ideas? :)
I hope you guys get some inspiration from this video and create a travel journal of your own. They're super fun to make and even more fun to look back on. Thank you so much for watching!

I've had an amazing time in the states a few months back and from the 2000+ clips that I’ve filmed came these 7 adventure filled vlogs!

The travel vlogs this time round are a bit different to my previous ones because the main purpose of my trip was to visit my friends who I’ve not seen for almost 3 years! I didn’t do as much touristy stuff but I still had a blast!  Hope you enjoy watching them and thanks for the support as always! x

163,163,nPYHWec2Yug,In the Land of the Canyons (USA) Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Even in daytime the moon seems to watch over the magnificent and fascinating world of the Grand Canyon, one of the world’s most famous natural wonders.  This incomparable and beautiful canyon extends for several hundred kilometres in the northwest of Arizona. The secrets of the Canyon’s huge rock walls and deep valleys lay hidden for many years.  Archaeological discoveries have shown that the Anasazi, a tribe of Native American Indians, were the first to settle within this region. From its source in the Rocky Mountains to its estuary in the Gulf Of Mexico, the Colorado River flows at an altitude of nearly three thousand metres above sea level.  The rocks, sand and mud that are carried along with the water cut relentlessly into the stony ground. The deepest point of the canyons descends for 1,800 metres.  Over the course of millions of years erosion and the incessant force of the river have created a unique and captivating landscape. Some kilometres south of the town of Page and Lake Powell and in the middle of a Navajo Indian reservation is a further natural masterpiece, Antelope Canyon.  The bizarre, smooth walls and red sandstone formations as well as the marvellous natural light effects within the canyon are quite remarkable. Canyonlands is a national park of the same name in the south east of Utah where numerous canyons and steep river valleys seem to touch the horizon. The Valley Of Fire is situated in the oldest national park in Nevada and is also the location of Fire Canyon.  Approximately eighty kilometres from Las Vegas the environment here provides a healthy and relaxing atmosphere compared to the neon lifestyle of the biggest gambling paradise in the world. When the Rocky Mountains began to develop more than ten million years ago and the Earth’s crust started to shift upwards, the Colorado Plateau formed and thus the smaller Paunsaugunt Plateau, the geological foundation of Bryce Canyon. The natural scenery in the western region of the U.S.A. is a land of revelation, a fantastic world of mystique, power and amazing colour.

I'd like to show you America's Greatest Landmarks

The National Mall is known as the hub of historic activities in Washington DC. Lavishly spread across acres of green grass, this open area national park has been often used for public demonstrations, marches, rallies and concerts. The area of the park extends from the illustrious capital building to the proud Lincoln Memorial.

One of the most iconic bridges in the world, The Golden Gate Bridge connects San Francisco to the tip of Marin County. This suspension bridge, completed in 1937, is also famous for its so called ""International Orange"" color produced by the sealant used. A dazzling approximate 118 thousand cars pass through this mighty structure every day, a testament to its impressive engineering.

Shining brilliantly on New York Harbor's Liberty Island, is the Statue of Liberty. A rather generous gift from the French nation, the statue consists of a representation of the Roman Goddess of freedom clasping a torch. Arguably the most popular internationally recognizable symbol of America, it also stands as an effigy of freedom.

The Mount Rushmore National Memorial is an enduring symbol of freedom and hope which graces the lands of South Dakota. Four former presidents have been elegantly carved 60 feet high into Mount Rushmore. A national treasure, the monument pays homage to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.

This resplendent brick Georgian building in Philadelphia is Independence Hall. This majestic monument has witnessed many historic events in the history of United States. The signing of The Declaration of Independence and the adoption of the United States Constitution took place in this glorious structure.",travel

Travel video about destination Utah in USA.
The State of Utah is located in the south west of the United States of America is a land of endless horizons, canyons, deserts and big open spaces. What Mecca is to the Moslems and Rome is to the Catholics is what Salt Lake City is to the Mormons. It is also the capital of the U.S. federal state of Utah. The prosperous city also contains many of those of other faiths but the highly influential Mormon church makes most of the region’s political decisions. The administrative HQ of the world wide active Mormon church is, at a hundred and twenty eight metres high, the city’s tallest building. The religion’s financial might and strict administration still exist today. Each member has to contribute one tenth of his or her income thus the Council Of The Twelve Apostles and the church presidency are a wealthy multinational concern. The Bonneville Salt Flats are located next to Great Salt Lake, a huge area covered by salt that is one of the flattest areas in the world. The lake was once used for motor sports and on the Salt Flats racing drivers in rocket-shaped cars attempted to beat one land speed record after the other. Zion National Park is not only a place of natural history as signs of human habitation have also been discovered here. Several of the park’s archaeological sites indicate that Man inhabited this region more than two thousand years ago. It is believed that its earliest prehistoric inhabitants were the legendary Anasazi Indians, followed by the Paiute Tribe. This land of red rock, the Great Salt Lake and remarkable canyons is a wonderful world at the edge of civilisation created by the might of natural forces. A desert land where water is vital and the supply of which is now assured by modern technology. All this is Utah, a dream world of deep canyons and vast open spaces

Our trip got off to a crazy start. Arriving in London we learned that our flight to New York was canceled. To our delight we found out we were going to be put up in a 5 star hotel! The next morning when rescheduling our flight, jokingly, I asked if we could be put on a flight to San Francisco. The employee laughed the suggestion off however after chatting to her for a while she broke the best news ever. She was finishing work in five minutes and she would put us on the flight to San Francisco. What a way to start our holiday.

Starting in San Francisco we worked our way down the west coast stopping off at Yosemite, Ocean Beach, Lake Tahoe, Alcatraz, Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Malibu, Las Vegas, Grand Canyon and Havasupi Falls. Flying to the east coast was not an option for us so instead we opted for a 49-hour train from Tucson Arizona to New Orleans Louisiana. After one night in New Orleans we boarded a 20-hour bus to Myrtle Beach. After spending 2 nights in Myrtle beach we set off on another road trip down the east coast stopping at Miami, Key West, Orlando and Cape Canaveral. To keep our trip cheap we camped most night's. Had the time of our lives! I flew home from Charlotte, North Carolina. Filmed on GoPro hero - White. Feel free to like or comment. Hope you enjoy.

225,225,xwBUvbi2DR4,Niagara Falls New York city USA | Visit New york city | compilation Travel Videos Guide,"Niagara Falls (/naɪˈæɡrə/, Cayuga: Gahnawehtaˀ or Tgahnawęhtaˀ[1]) is the collective name for three waterfalls that straddle the international border between Canada and the United States; more specifically, between the province of Ontario and the state of New York. They form the southern end of the Niagara Gorge.

From largest to smallest, the three waterfalls are the Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the Bridal Veil Falls. The Horseshoe Falls lie mostly on the Canadian side and the American Falls entirely on the American side, separated by Goat Island. The smaller Bridal Veil Falls are also located on the American side, separated from the other waterfalls by Luna Island. The international boundary line was originally drawn through Horseshoe Falls in 1819, but the boundary has long been in dispute due to natural erosion and construction.[2] More info visit:

233,233,8mrXeThYB9k,"IF YOU TRAVEL USA, YOU NEED TO COME HERE! 🇺🇸 Navajo Nation : Monument Valley","Welcome to Mars... AKA Monument Valley

If you plan to travel around America, you should definitely add this place to your list. It's right on the border of Arizona and Utah. 

Many people just come for the day, but it's so much better to stay the night and camp out in the desert near Monument Valley. If you want to camp out here, you'll need to organize it with a tour company and I highly recommend Navajo Spirit Tours. We learned so much about the Navajo Nation Tribe. Larson, our tour guide, was happy to share his experience growing up in this beautiful area and it was really interesting getting to know him and experience the Navajo culture.

Chicago officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States. With over 2.7 million residents, it is also the most populous city in both the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States. It is the county seat of Cook County. 

The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicago land, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the United States.Chicago has often been called a global architecture capital and is considered one of the most important business centers in the world.

Chicago City was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed and grew rapidly in the mid-nineteenth century.

After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, the city made a concerted effort to rebuild on the damage.
 
The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by 1900 Chicago was one of the five largest cities in the world.

During this period Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards, new construction styles ,the development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the eventual creation of the steel-framed skyscraper.

Positioned along Lake Michigan, the city is an international hub for finance, commerce, industry, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. 

O'Hare International Airport is the second-busiest airport in the world when measured by aircraft traffic; the region also has the largest number of U.S. highways and railroad freight. In 2012, Chicago was listed as an alpha global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, and it ranked seventh in the world in the 2016 Global Cities Index. 

Chicago has the third-largest gross metropolitan product in the United States—about $640 billion according to 2015 estimates.

The city has one of the world's largest and most diversified economies, with no single industry employing more than 14% of the workforce.

In 2016, Chicago hosted a record 54 million domestic and international visitors, making it one of the most visited cities in the United States.

Landmarks in the city include Millennium Park, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum Campus, the Willis Tower, the Museum of Science and Industry, and Lincoln Park Zoo. 

Chicago's culture includes the visual arts, novels, film, theater, and music, particularly jazz, blues, soul, hip-hop, gospel, and house music. 

There are many colleges and universities in the Chicago area, of which Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Illinois at Chicago are classified as ""highest research"" doctoral universities.

Chicago has professional sports teams in each of the major professional leagues. The city has many nicknames, the best known being the Windy City and Chi-Town

Chicago is located in northeastern Illinois on the southwestern shores of Lake Michigan.
It is the principal city in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, situated in the Midwestern United States and the Great Lakes region. Chicago rests on a continental divide at the site of the Chicago Portage, connecting the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes watersheds. 

The city lies beside huge freshwater Lake Michigan, and two rivers the Chicago River in downtown and the Calumet River in the industrial far South Side—flow entirely or partially through Chicago.

Chicago's history and economy are closely tied to its proximity to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's waterborne cargo, today's huge lake freighters use the city's Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side. 

The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.

When Chicago was founded in 1837, most of the early building was around the mouth of the Chicago River,as can be seen on a map of the city's original 58 blocks.

The overall grade of the city's central, built-up areas, is relatively consistent with the natural flatness of its overall natural geography, generally exhibiting only slight differentiation otherwise.

1. Koľko máš rokov? - 22
2. Kde upravuješ videá? - Adobe Premiere Elements 13 alebo iMovie

4.Kde bývaš? - Žilina/Banská Bystrica, momentálne Lisabon

O MNE
Moje meno je Eva Lokajová (Evs Lok) a momentálne mám 21 rokov (rok narodenia 1995). Už ako malá som si písala svoj tajný denník a o pár rokov som si vytvorila práve jeho online verziu – blog. Celú blogerskú sféru som vnímala už od približne 12. rokov. Móda, krása a inšpirácie. To všetko som mala v malíčku haha. Počas tohto obdobia som študovala na súkromnej obchodnej akadémii v Žiline, kde som sa aj narodila a žijem tu dodnes. Teda.. ako sa to vezme. Život ma totiž zaviedol aj do Banskej Bystrice, kde momentálne študujem Cestovný ruch na Ekonomickej fakulte Univerzity Mateja Bela. Čo moja osobnosť? Miestami vážny introvert a inokedy zase neznesiteľný extrovert. Čo sa ale nevezme je to, že som strašne pojašená a niekedy mi nie je rady. Mám rada cestovanie (za hranicami, ale aj doma!) a s ním spojené dobrodružstvo , objavovanie nových miest, spoznávanie nových kultúr a ľudí. Zdieľať také to “happiness” je u mňa základ!

284,284,GKvYV8xQQm8,Кому не стоит участвовать в программе Work and Travel USA l SWAT.UA,"Возможности, которые откроются перед теми, кто поедет по программе Work and Travel USA. 

1. Язык. 
В первую очередь, вы не просто подтяните свой уровень английского языка, но и избавитесь от всевозможных разговорных барьеров и научитесь различать как минимум 5 видов американского акцента. А факт того, что ваш словарный запас увеличится в два, а то и в три раза однозначно поможет вам в жизни. Ведь намного круче смотреть любимого Гари Поттера, Диснеевские мультфильмы и Друзей или любой другой любимый сериал в оригинальном переводе. Ведь никакая озвучка не передаст тех эмоций, с которыми играли актеры во время съемок.

2. Карьера.                  
Карьера. Нельзя не отметить этот пункт. Ведь само собой все хотят высокооплачиваемую работу, карьерный рост и признание. Но если придя на собеседование скажешь работодателю только «Ландан из зе кепитал оф грейт британ» и что ты классный малый, вряд ли этого будет достаточно. Другое дело, когда есть опыт работы в американской компании и вполне себе fluent level of English. Если вы рождены для того, чтобы стать бизнесменом, а такими именно рождаются, то лучшего места, чем США, чтобы найти свою бизнес-идею – не придумаешь. Ведь сколько было тенденций, которыми пользовались в Америке не один год, а в Украину они пришли только вот-вот. К примеру убер. Слышал про него год назад? А с недавних пор у нас этим сервисом пользуется каждый 3й. Обо всех новинках ты сможешь узнать первым! 

3. Путешествия. 
Скажите, как можно спокойно всю жизнь сидеть в четырех стенах, зная, что в мире есть столько всего интересного. Бушующие океаны, захватывающие бейсбольные матчи, невероятные пейзажи парков и каньонов, вкусная, не смотря на то, что калорийная американская еда и просто люди, которые совсем другие, но до жути интересные. После того как закончится рабочий период, начинается время путешествий. Перед тобой откроются бескрайние возможности отправиться, будь то на белоснежные пляжи Майями, к безумным каньонам Аризоны и к каменным джунглям Нью Йорка или Чикаго. Можно просто положить перед собой карту штатов Америки, с закрытыми глазами ткнуть туда пальцем и в эту же секунду уже забронировать билеты на автобус или самолет в штат, который выбрали наугад. 

4. Успей!
Мы привыкли все оттягивать до последнего, такова человеческая природа. Но для того, чтобы чего-то в этой жизни добиться и прожить её не скучно нужно идти против своей природы. Так же и с программой ворк энд тревел. Пока ты на 1 курсе провести лето на другом континенте – это страшно, безусловно. Но когда ты на 5 или 6 – уже поздно. Наибольшая вероятность получить визу у студентов 1, 2 и 3 курса. По этому если одному страшно, нужно взять с собой пару, тройку друзей и айда покорять неизведанные земли. После первого раза понравится, гарантирую. И те, кто поехал на первом курсе смогут получить ещё два следующих незабываемых лета, такой себе бонус. После второго курса можно будет поехать ещё один раз. Ну а если поехал на 3 курсе, то уже нужно хорошенько задуматься, стоит ли ехать в следующем году или нет. Так как получить визу на 4 курсе гораздо сложнее, шансы уменьшаются ровно в половину. 

5. Самостоятельность.
Просто представь себе....Америка, лето, и только от тебя зависит то, как ты его проведешь. Не нужно бояться чего-то нового, хватит сидеть в своей зоне комфорта. Да тебе придется общаться с работодателем, много чего самостоятельно решать, но ведь когда-то же нужно начинать. Могут быть проблемы, которые придется решать, но также будет много веселья, вечеринок, настоящих амереканских вечеринок и никакого контроля, кроме своего собственного.  Там все делается намного проще, авантюрнее и беззаботнее. Заработал за неделю 400 долларов? Слетал в Калифорнию, или обновил себе гардероб или переехал в другие апартаменты, да что угодно. Главное, искоренить в себе лень и иметь огромнейшее желание.

Не съм ви се отблагодарил още, че достигнахме 1000 абоната и реших да направя малко по-дълго видео с което да изясним темата дали е добра идея да направите бригада в САЩ.

За тази цел поканих един мой приятел, който беше в Щатите две години и двамата ще ви дадем съвети, на които ние бихме се радвали преди да заминем.

291,291,YImGf-D-hTE,Colorado Vacation Travel Video Guide,"Travel video about destination Colorado.
Colorado is situated in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, a land of remote valleys and high mountains.Denver is the state capital and is located on a sunny high plateau sixteen hundred metres above sea level where the local inhabitants enjoy more sunshine throughout the year than in California’s San Diego or even Honolulu. Skyscrapers between the prairie and the Rockies, a somewhat surreal city in which various power industry companies are to be found. The 16th Street Mall is the city’s pride and a splendid avenue that boasts the longest pedestrianised area in the USA plus a free bus service! It contains several shopping malls, restaurants and all kinds of shops with products from all over the world. The shining red rocks on the outskirts of Colorado Springs are a striking spectacle within the Garden Of The Gods. The huge red sandstone rock formations rise to a height of up to a hundred and fifty metres.  The natural monuments are a reminder of the geological past of this extraordinary region situated at the foot of the Rocky Mountains Directly next to the caves at the foot of Pike’s Peak are the caves in which the Anasazi Indians once lived, the famous Cliff Dwellings where one can gain a fascinating insight into the culture of the native inhabitants of North America, how they lived, their culture and beliefs. The Indian Museum features Indian culture and work tools and is an impressive record of a long forgotten time and a people that almost became extinct. Sprague Lake is one of the region’s many glacial lakes and is ideal for walkers as well as anglers and boat enthusiasts, and several ranches offer accommodation. Ghost towns, gold mines, ancient cultures and mountain paradises, Native Indians, explorers, fur traders and gold prospectors, all the ingredients of the colourful history of America’s wild West. Colorado is indeed a place of spectacular nature and breathtaking adventure!

Breathtaking waterfalls, high rock walls and an enchanting wilderness have made Yosemite Park famous. The uniqueness of this wonderful rock landscape was recognized many years ago thus this Californian national park is the second oldest nature reserve in the United States.At Yosemite Falls the steep rocks tower up more than seven hundred metres and it is the park’s highest and also most impressive waterfall. The surrounding forests are also attractive but the most famous sight in this region are the nine waterfalls of Yosemite Valley. Up until the beginning of the great Californian Gold Rush around the middle of the 19th century this unique mountain landscape was mostly untouched and those in search of gold headed for Merced River. Not far from the 2,700 metre high Half Dome, one of the most well known landmarks in the park, there are even more wonderful waterfalls. The beautiful rainbows that extend through the delicate mist of falling water add even more splendour to the dreamlike scenery. The beauty of the wilderness, waterfalls, rivers, forests and rock walls of today’s Yosemite National Park have combined to create a perfect work of natural art.

Not far from the small village of Escalante in the State of Utah a fascinating colourful landscape extends across several plateaus. Due to an unusual geological phenomenon that is similar to several steps, it is known as the Grand Staircase. This Nature Reserve is one of the most recent parks in the United States its inauguration having taken place in 1996. The history of this natural region is as multi-layered as the rocks and walls of the land itself and it covers a wilderness of approximately 690,000 hectares. It has five different vegetation zones and thus boasts a remarkable variety of indigenous trees and plants and is divided into three vast areas: the Grand Staircase, the Kaiparowits Plateau and the Escalante Canyons.The region is also of great importance from both a cultural and historical point of view as it contains traces of the ancient Native American Fremont and Anasazi Indians.Above the rock walls on the Kaiparowits Plateau archaeologists discovered even older traces of human existence and also objects that date back to Prehistoric times.The scenery is indeed similar to a huge and magnificent 'grand staircase' and is, without a doubt, a truly natural wonder of the world.

The song which I chose is a moment which had always given me goosebumps from a movie ""Wake up Sid"", where a spoiled kid who doesn't have any aim in life at the beginning and only rely on spending his dad's money and leaves his family to live alone to find a purpose in his life. This song comes when he gets his first paycheck from the job he loved and he visits his dad's office with that news but in my case the planning was similar but it turned out that he was not at his office when I arrived and got locked out of home for one hour because my mom and sister went out running some errands.

On the western edge of the state of Colorado and close to the city of Grand Junction and the village of Fruita, is the Colorado National Monument, one of the most fascinating areas in the United States Of America.From the twenty three mile long Rim Rock Drive there is a magnificent view across the eroded rock walls of the mighty canyons. Fir, juniper and mahogany trees form the main vegetation on the high plateaus that are located above the sparsely covered canyons. The amazing rock walls plunge down almost three hundred metres to the bottom of the dried out canyons below that are dominated by typical desert vegetation. There is a kind of magic here, a special feeling: and it is easy to become enchanted by this truly amazing region that has been sculpted by the natural forces of nature.

Take in the many splendors of the nation’s capital when you arrive at Washington, D.C.

Your Washington, D.C. tour should start at the National Mall, where you’ll find monuments, memorials, and government buildings instead of tons of shopping. If you’d like to get around town easily but don’t want to rent a car, the Capital Bikeshare program will let you cruise around the city without wasting gas or getting stuck in traffic.

Check out the Watergate Hotel and Kennedy Center when you stop at Foggy Bottom, then move on to Georgetown, the oldest district in D.C. It’s filled with 18th-century buildings and, of course, the university itself. After a stop at the National Cathedral, make your way to the Smithsonian National Zoo, the perfect stop for the young and the young at heart.

If you’re feeling the need to channel your inner 007, go to the International Spy Museum, and learn about the covert operations and intelligence agencies that have shaped the world we live in. Of course, you can’t enjoy any Washington, D.C., tourism without admiring the White House, so make sure that’s on your list too.

Visit our Washington, D.C., travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!

North Dakota is a midwestern U.S. state dominated by the Great Plains. Its eastern city of Fargo showcases Native American and modern art at the Plains Art Museum. The area's immigrant history is honored at the Scandinavian Heritage Association in the city of Minot. The Great Plains give way to the rugged Badlands near the border with Montana, where Theodore Roosevelt National Park spans the Little Missouri River.

Apple Park Visitor Center is a two-story structure with four main areas: an Apple Store featuring Apple-branded merchandise (T-shirts, hats, tote bags, post cards) not sold at regular Apple stores, a 2,386 sq ft (221.7 m2) café, an exhibition space which currently showcases a 3D model of Apple Park with augmented reality, and a roof terrace overlooking the campus. It opened to the public on November 17, 2017. The estimated cost of the center is $80M. 

Apple's corporate headquarters was originally located at Building 1 on 20525 Mariani Ave in Cupertino. The land east of Mariani One across De Anza Boulevard where the campus was built was originally occupied by the company Four-Phase Systems . It has an area of 850,000 square feet (79,000 m2). Construction began in 1992 and was completed in 1993 by the Sobrato Development Company. Before 1997, activities held on the campus were exclusively research and development. Until that time the buildings were referred to as R&D 1-6. With the return of Steve Jobs to Apple in 1997, changes were made to the campus: Apple increased the number of occupied buildings, and many activities not related to R&D were moved to the buildings on Infinite Loop, at which point they began to be referenced by their IL # designations. Steve Jobs left additional marks on the campus, for example, banning employees' pets and dramatically improving the cafeteria menu.

370,370,x4niPTz9t9g,"Niagara Falls - Canada, USA HD Travel Channel","The Niagara Falls, arguably the most spectacular natural wonders of Canada are located at the border between the U.S. state of New York and the Canadian province of Ontario, about 130 km from Toronto. Approximately 4,000 cubic meters per second rush 52 in depth. The crescent-shaped Horseshoe Falls are about 792 m, the straight American Falls about 363 m long.
From the Skylon tower you have a fantastic view on the Canadian Horseshoe Falls, the American Falls and the casino area. You can see the Maid of the Mist approaching the danger area. 
Every second attempt to cruise the falls with tons or boats ended fatally.  October 2003, a probably suicidal man threw himself into the Horseshoe Falls, but contrary to his intention he survived with only minor injuries. It was probably the first time anyone overmasters the falls without aids
In the extreme cold wave in January 1936 ice barrier, several hundred meter wide blocked the flow of water for several hours. This was the only known time that the falls were free of water due to natural causes.
 Every year millions of people visit the falls.

Die Niagarafälle, wohl das spektakulärste Naturwunder Kanadas,  liegen  an der Grenze zwischen dem US-amerikanischen Bundesstaat New York und der kanadischen Provinz Ontario, ca. 130 km von Toronto entfernt.  Ungefähr die doppelte Wassermenge des Rheins  (ca. 4.000 Kubikmeter pro Sekunde) stürzt hier 52 m in die Tiefe. Die sichelförmigen Horseshoe Falls sind ca. 792 m, die gradlinigen American Falls ca. 363 m lang.
Vom Skylon Tower hat man einen fantastischen Ausblick auf die kanadischen Horseshoe Falls, die American Falls und die Casino Areas.  Von hier aus kann man auch beobachten, wie gefährlich weit sich die „Maid of the Mist“ an die Gefahrenzone vorwagt. 
Jeder zweite Versuch, die Fälle mit Tonnen oder Booten zu befahren, endete tödlich. Im Oktober 2003 aber überlebte ein vermutlich lebensmüder Mann, der sich in die Horseshoe Falls warf, entgegen seiner Absicht mit nur leichten Verletzungen. Es dürfte das erste Mal gewesen sein, dass jemand die Fälle ohne Hilfsmittel bezwang.
In der extremen Kältewelle Januar 1936 froren die Fälle ein. Eine mehrere hundert Meter breite Eisbarriere sperrte für einige Stunden den Wasserzufluss; das einzige bekannte Mal, dass die Fälle auf Grund einer natürlichen Ursache wasserfrei waren.
Jährlich besuchen Millionen Menschen die Wasserfälle.

372,372,Uuc7YngSjDY,"Visit New York - 5 Things You Will Love & Hate about New York City, USA","Visiting the Big Apple of New York City Can Be Amazing or Something Besides Amazing. Here we go through the best and the worst of visiting New York City. From the I LOVE NYC Shirt crowd to the amazing culture and food, to the toilets that make you not want to go to the bathroom and smells that remind you of your junior high cafeteria 20 years ago. The 5 Things you Will Love & Hate about Visiting New York City! 
Filmed on Ellis Island, USA
Copyright Mark Wolters 2016
The Hates of New York City
#1. The random nasty smells that New York sometimes produces. 
#2. 
#3. Your Subway Experience - the subway goes everywhere in New York and that is awesome, however the crowded rush hour traffic, the interesting people and mistaking a local and an express train can make it for a bit of a headache.
#4. Your Sidewalk Experience. Make sure you step to the side when you want to take pictures in NYC. Otherwise be prepared to be bowled over by locals, tourists and any number of random things. 
#5. The lack of clean public toilets... just make sure you use the toilet before you leave the hotel and if you really need a toilet the museums tend to have decent public toilets. 

The Loves of New York City
#1. Exploring and Wandering New York - from seeing the Empire State Building for the first time to strolling Central Park and Brooklyn there is so much to enjoy just walking around and enjoying New York. 
#2. The amount of cultural opportunities New York has - from world class museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the American Museum of Natural History to the Museum of Modern Art and Ellis Island, New York and around has a number of cultural outings for all types of travelers. 
#3. The New York-isms - from having a slice of NYC pizza to bagels at a diner to a deli lunch to the crazy people screaming and the iconic sights, New York is so... New York and you will love it!
#4. The Diversity and Multiculturalism of New York City. From the numerous neighborhoods, restaurants and bodegas to the languages, foods and fun, there is something from everywhere and for everyone in New York. 
#5. The New Yorkers - though they get a bad rap, the people of New York really are great and can be one of the most enjoyable and surprising parts of visiting New York City.
