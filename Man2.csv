6,LVtBjFUfFLE,BMW 3 Series Body Assembly Line,"The BMW Group is investing half a billion euros in building the new BMW 3 Series at the Munich plant, where series production launches today.

""The BMW 3 Series is the most important volume-produced model from the BMW Group as well as the biggest-selling model in the entire premium segment. To ensure that the sixth generation of the BMW 3 Series likewise leaves the factory in flawless quality, we have invested around 500 million euros in our Munich home plant. And that means safeguarding 9,000 workplaces,"" said Frank-Peter Arndt, Member of the BMW AG Board of Management responsible for production, in Munich on Friday.

As series production of the new BMW 3 Series Sedan got under way, Christian Ude, Mayor of Munich, along with Manfred Schoch, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the BMW Group, also spoke before a large gathering of employees at the BMW plant in Munich.

2012 BMW 3 Series production starts today in Munich plant

""As Munich residents we can count ourselves fortunate that the decision to build the new 3 Series here signals a clear and impressive commitment to Munich on the part of BMW,"" said Christian Ude. ""BMW is not just one of our major employers and corporate tax payers, but beyond that also actively contributes to the wellbeing of the city.""

Manfred Schoch added: ""Credit for this achievement on the part of the Munich site must also go to the highly motivated and committed employees who invest huge efforts and true dedication into ensuring that this location retains its attractiveness and competitive edge.""

The production launch of the sixth-generation BMW 3 Series marks the start of a new era at the Munich home plant. The investments have flowed, among other areas, into innovative production equipment and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies. They form part of a long-term strategy aimed at strengthening the competitiveness and future viability of the Munich plant and thereby safeguarding 9,000 workplaces in the Bavarian state capital. In doing so, the BMW Group is signalling a special commitment to social responsibility at its headquarters.

The production plant in Munich is a firm fixture of the BMW Group's global production network. It acts as the lead plant worldwide for production of the new BMW 3 Series. All regions across the globe will be supplied directly from the home plant to ensure a simultaneous market launch. Furthermore, it was the Munich plant that determined the assembly sequencing and process architecture for the production of the BMW 3 Series on behalf of the entire production network. Thanks to the standardised manufacturing processes and efficient production systems, the ramp-up at the Munich plant will be very short. Just three months after the start of production of the BMW 3 Series Sedan, peak output of 680 units a day will be achieved. Total output at the plant will then exceed 900 vehicles per day.


Munich plant sets benchmarks for modern car construction.
Its location within the city presents the BMW Munich plant with some special challenges. The complex production infrastructure, set out across a total area of some 700,000 square metres, calls for extremely high density and means that the most important volume-produced model of the Bavarian premium manufacturer is built on up to five different floors. The smooth coordination between production, logistics, transport and administration within such a confined space is an achievement that ranks as a tour de force in modern-day automotive construction worldwide.

State-of-the-art facilities for innovative vehicle production.
To ensure the utmost precision and efficiency, new production structures were created for all the manufacturing areas.

Building the sixth generation of the BMW 3 Series thus benefits, for example, from a new large press. At 17 strokes per minute, this installation counts among the most advanced in the world. It achieves throughput of 600 tonnes of steel per day and develops press forces of 650 to 2,500 tonnes. In a matter of 12 days, then, this high-performance facility processes a similar amount of steel as went into the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The new production infrastructure also ensures the highest possible economy of space and optimal material flows. Beyond that, the high-tech press enables an improvement in quality and efficiency.

In the running to establish electric vehicles, Tesla initially appeared to have left the rest of the car industry in the dust. But things have gotten tougher for Elon Musk‚Äôs crown jewel company. The race to dominate the market for the car of the future has entered a critical phase.

Tesla has set new standards in the automotive industry. For years, its CEO was as celebrated as any rock star. But both the boss and his company are coming under increased fire from critics. Employees have claimed working conditions at production facilities are chaotic and often questionable. Production on the Tesla assembly lines has often been brought to a standstill. Meanwhile, losses are growing, while Musk‚Äôs reputation has also become somewhat dented and scratched. Meanwhile, other major car brands are working at top speed to bump Tesla from its pole position, with Porsche leading the pack. Little is known about the German carmaker‚Äôs new electric Taycan model, but this documentary reveals just how dangerous a new electric Porsche could be for Tesla. And major carmakers have another trump card to play. They have decades of experience in the mass production of cars, while Tesla is still a newcomer to the field. The film also shows how much German technology is hidden in Tesla models, and how both Musk and new Chinese competition are betting on German expertise. The race to dominate the market for electric cars is far from over.

64,VeQQCNiQ8Q,Audi Cars Manufacturing Process,"Audi Cars Manufacturing Process
Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data ‚Äì the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data ‚Äì will facilitate data‚Äëdriven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future ‚Äì from the application of virtual‚Äëreality glasses to metal 3D printing.

Modular assembly.
The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.

Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines ‚Äì in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems ‚Äì it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.

Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Gy≈ër, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.

At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by ‚Äúarculus‚Äù ‚Äì a startup company established a few months ago.

The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.
The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechnology Development Production Assistance Systems‚Äù department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‚Äësoftware development processes.

The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.

The Audi Production Lab.
The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‚ÄëLab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process ‚Äì often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‚Äërobot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.

The projects currently running in the P‚ÄëLab include two big‚Äëdata projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future ‚Äì with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.

Toolmaking.
Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi‚Äôs Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‚Äëmetal parts.

The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‚Äëmetal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

72,LVtBjFUfFLE,BMW 3 Series Body Assembly Line,"The BMW Group is investing half a billion euros in building the new BMW 3 Series at the Munich plant, where series production launches today.

""The BMW 3 Series is the most important volume-produced model from the BMW Group as well as the biggest-selling model in the entire premium segment. To ensure that the sixth generation of the BMW 3 Series likewise leaves the factory in flawless quality, we have invested around 500 million euros in our Munich home plant. And that means safeguarding 9,000 workplaces,"" said Frank-Peter Arndt, Member of the BMW AG Board of Management responsible for production, in Munich on Friday.

As series production of the new BMW 3 Series Sedan got under way, Christian Ude, Mayor of Munich, along with Manfred Schoch, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the BMW Group, also spoke before a large gathering of employees at the BMW plant in Munich.

2012 BMW 3 Series production starts today in Munich plant

""As Munich residents we can count ourselves fortunate that the decision to build the new 3 Series here signals a clear and impressive commitment to Munich on the part of BMW,"" said Christian Ude. ""BMW is not just one of our major employers and corporate tax payers, but beyond that also actively contributes to the wellbeing of the city.""

Manfred Schoch added: ""Credit for this achievement on the part of the Munich site must also go to the highly motivated and committed employees who invest huge efforts and true dedication into ensuring that this location retains its attractiveness and competitive edge.""

The production launch of the sixth-generation BMW 3 Series marks the start of a new era at the Munich home plant. The investments have flowed, among other areas, into innovative production equipment and state-of-the-art manufacturing technologies. They form part of a long-term strategy aimed at strengthening the competitiveness and future viability of the Munich plant and thereby safeguarding 9,000 workplaces in the Bavarian state capital. In doing so, the BMW Group is signalling a special commitment to social responsibility at its headquarters.

The production plant in Munich is a firm fixture of the BMW Group's global production network. It acts as the lead plant worldwide for production of the new BMW 3 Series. All regions across the globe will be supplied directly from the home plant to ensure a simultaneous market launch. Furthermore, it was the Munich plant that determined the assembly sequencing and process architecture for the production of the BMW 3 Series on behalf of the entire production network. Thanks to the standardised manufacturing processes and efficient production systems, the ramp-up at the Munich plant will be very short. Just three months after the start of production of the BMW 3 Series Sedan, peak output of 680 units a day will be achieved. Total output at the plant will then exceed 900 vehicles per day.


Munich plant sets benchmarks for modern car construction.
Its location within the city presents the BMW Munich plant with some special challenges. The complex production infrastructure, set out across a total area of some 700,000 square metres, calls for extremely high density and means that the most important volume-produced model of the Bavarian premium manufacturer is built on up to five different floors. The smooth coordination between production, logistics, transport and administration within such a confined space is an achievement that ranks as a tour de force in modern-day automotive construction worldwide.

State-of-the-art facilities for innovative vehicle production.
To ensure the utmost precision and efficiency, new production structures were created for all the manufacturing areas.

Building the sixth generation of the BMW 3 Series thus benefits, for example, from a new large press. At 17 strokes per minute, this installation counts among the most advanced in the world. It achieves throughput of 600 tonnes of steel per day and develops press forces of 650 to 2,500 tonnes. In a matter of 12 days, then, this high-performance facility processes a similar amount of steel as went into the construction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The new production infrastructure also ensures the highest possible economy of space and optimal material flows. Beyond that, the high-tech press enables an improvement in quality and efficiency.

In the running to establish electric vehicles, Tesla initially appeared to have left the rest of the car industry in the dust. But things have gotten tougher for Elon Musk‚Äôs crown jewel company. The race to dominate the market for the car of the future has entered a critical phase.

Tesla has set new standards in the automotive industry. For years, its CEO was as celebrated as any rock star. But both the boss and his company are coming under increased fire from critics. Employees have claimed working conditions at production facilities are chaotic and often questionable. Production on the Tesla assembly lines has often been brought to a standstill. Meanwhile, losses are growing, while Musk‚Äôs reputation has also become somewhat dented and scratched. Meanwhile, other major car brands are working at top speed to bump Tesla from its pole position, with Porsche leading the pack. Little is known about the German carmaker‚Äôs new electric Taycan model, but this documentary reveals just how dangerous a new electric Porsche could be for Tesla. And major carmakers have another trump card to play. They have decades of experience in the mass production of cars, while Tesla is still a newcomer to the field. The film also shows how much German technology is hidden in Tesla models, and how both Musk and new Chinese competition are betting on German expertise. The race to dominate the market for electric cars is far from over.

130,VeQQCNiQ8Q,Audi Cars Manufacturing Process,"Audi Cars Manufacturing Process
Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data ‚Äì the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data ‚Äì will facilitate data‚Äëdriven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future ‚Äì from the application of virtual‚Äëreality glasses to metal 3D printing.

Modular assembly.
The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.

Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines ‚Äì in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems ‚Äì it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.

Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Gy≈ër, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.

At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by ‚Äúarculus‚Äù ‚Äì a startup company established a few months ago.

The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.
The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechnology Development Production Assistance Systems‚Äù department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‚Äësoftware development processes.

The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.

The Audi Production Lab.
The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‚ÄëLab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process ‚Äì often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‚Äërobot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.

The projects currently running in the P‚ÄëLab include two big‚Äëdata projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future ‚Äì with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.

Toolmaking.
Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi‚Äôs Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‚Äëmetal parts.

The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‚Äëmetal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

160,XPUno4Lb_MI,Rolls-Royce Production - Awesome,"Rolls-Royce Production Assembly Line.

Rolls-Royce Motor Cars has today revealed record sales results for a fifth consecutive year, with 4,063 cars sold globally during 2014. This exceptional result means that sales have more than quadrupled since 2009.

Strong sales were reported worldwide, with double-digit growth in most regions, North America (up 30%), the Middle East (up 20%) and Europe (up 40%). The United States remained the company‚Äôs most significant individual market. Rolls-Royce‚Äôs home market, the United Kingdom, is the company‚Äôs fourth largest individual market (up 13%).

Europe saw strong growth in a number of markets with Germany up by 30%, while in Asia Pacific, Australia grew by 75%, Japan by 60% and Korea 20%. In the Middle East, highlights included Bahrain (up 50%), Kuwait (up 45%) and Oman (up 27%). Emerging markets such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Vietnam all showed promising growth.

The best-selling Rolls-Royce dealership in 2014 was Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Abu Dhabi. As part of the marque‚Äôs commitment to long-term sustainable growth, six new dealerships were opened in 2014, including Mexico City, Calgary, Canada and Gold Coast, Australia. A total of 127 dealerships are now in operation and further expansion is planned for 2015.

Torsten M√ºller-√ñtv√∂s, Chief Executive Officer, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars said, ‚ÄúThis fifth consecutive record year saw Rolls-Royce Motor Cars break through the 4,000 car sales level for the first time in its 111-year history. The result confirms that our strategy of balanced, sustainable and profitable growth is delivering and that Rolls-Royce remains the world‚Äôs leading luxury goods brand. This extraordinary success has been built on strong foundations: pinnacle products, dedicated people and a commitment to ensuring a balanced global sales picture.‚Äù

Sales were driven by strong orders for Ghost Series II, launched in November, and Wraith, which enjoyed its first full year of sales, while the incomparable Phantom remains the company‚Äôs pinnacle product.

Bespoke Collections including Waterspeed, Pinnacle Travel and Metropolitan, and unique creations such as the Maharaja Phantom Drophead Coup√© contributed to Rolls‚ÄëRoyce sustaining its leadership of the industry in the area of individualisation. In 2014, Rolls‚ÄëRoyce once again sold more cars in the +Euros 200,000 net segment than any other manufacturer.

2014 also marked the first year in which every Phantom, and the great majority of Ghost and Wraith models, left the Home of Rolls-Royce at Goodwood in West Sussex, England with significant Bespoke personalisation. A record number of customers spent personal one-on-one time with Rolls-Royce‚Äôs Bespoke design consultants commissioning their personalised vehicles.

To meet such strong demand, particularly for Bespoke cars, the company has created over 200 new permanent jobs in the past 18 months. More than 1,500 people are now employed at the Home of Rolls-Royce.

Further evidence of Rolls-Royce‚Äôs commitment to expansion in Great Britain came in September when the company announced plans for its new Technology and Logistics Centre at Bognor Regis, close to Goodwood. Construction of the new 30,000m2 facility, which is due to open in 2016, is well underway and around 200 new and existing staff in technical and logistics roles will be employed at the Centre.

Business Secretary, Vince Cable said, ‚ÄúRolls-Royce motor cars are famous throughout the world with increasing numbers now exported abroad. The skill and dedication of its workers here in Britain has led to another very successful year.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe UK‚Äôs automotive industry is thriving with a new car rolling off the production line every 20 seconds, and increasing levels of investment that‚Äôs helping to secure local jobs. Through our industrial strategy we are backing companies like Rolls-Royce Motor Cars as they go from strength to strength, giving them the right environment to invest with confidence and create high-skilled jobs"".

India's passenger car and commercial vehicle manufacturing industry is the sixth largest in the world, with an annual production of more than 3.9 million units in 2011. According to recent reports, India overtook Brazil and became the sixth largest passenger vehicle producer in the world. In 2009, India emerged as Asia's fourth largest exporter of passenger cars, behind Japan, South Korea, and Thailand. In 2010, India beat Thailand to become Asia's third largest exporter of passenger cars.

Some of the current Indian car manufacturing companies are Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, Premier Automobiles Limited, Hindustan Motors Ambassador, Chin Kara Motors, Force Motors, ICML, San Motors. Electric car manufacturers in India include Ajanta Group, Hero Electric, REVA now Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles, Tara International and Tata Motors.  A number of foreign firms also have joint ventures with Indian companies such as the Kirloskar group and Hindustan Motors, Maruti Suzuki to manufacture foreign brand cars for Indian as well as export market.

Growth of the sector:
India's automobile exports have grown consistently and reached $4.5 billion in 2009, with United Kingdom being India's largest export market followed by Italy, Germany, Netherlands and South Africa. India's automobile exports are expected to cross $12 billion by 2014.
According to New York Times, India's strong engineering base and expertise in the manufacturing of low-cost, fuel-efficient cars has resulted in the expansion of manufacturing facilities of several automobile companies like Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen and Maruti Suzuki.
In recent years, India has emerged as a leading center for the manufacture of small cars. Hyundai, the biggest exporter from the country, now ships more than 250,000 cars annually from India.",Manufacturing

188,CIRuU8qot3,End of the Road - Four Corners,"Monday 14 April 2014

Australians love their cars. And for much of the past six decades the cars they've loved most have been home-grown. In that time, Australia has been one of a select group of countries with the capacity to design, engineer and build its own cars. For 60 years that capacity has been a cornerstone of the country's industrial capacity. Now all that is about to change.

When the new Coalition Government made it clear it wasn't prepared to spend more money assisting the car industry, the big manufacturers Holden and Toyota said goodbye. Next on Four Corners, reporter Stephen Long looks at the impact as the car industry heads to the end of the road.

Long finds that for some, this represents a triumph of good policy with limited fallout:

""This form of restructuring will have quite profound effects on individual regions... but not necessarily have a significant effect on the economy as a whole."" Bill Scales, Former Head Automotive Industry Authority

Others see it as the road to potential economic ruin - a decision which, when taken to its logical conclusion, would make the economy vulnerable to external shocks:

""Australia will start to become a third world country in its living standard."" Professor Goran Roos, Advanced Manufacturing Council

Travelling to key industrial centres, Long reveals startling new research describing the likely impact of the car industry's demise. He talks to the workers who've already been pushed onto the unemployment lines and he goes into the factories of car-part makers desperately seeking new markets outside the automotive industry.

Respected industry experts warn that although manufacturers know they need to stop relying on making car components, as few as ten per cent might survive the transition.

Four Corners also looks at Britain's response to a failing car industry. Initially, like Australia, Britain took the view it didn't need car manufacturing. The Global Financial Crisis changed all that. Realising the folly of simply relying on service industries to supply jobs, the Government backed car makers in a way that has turned them into the country's biggest export sector.

190,ZBuSX5U1nHE,GM Car Manufacturing History,"GM has been one of the world's largest car and truck manufacturers, for more than a century and involves a vast scope of industrial activity around the world, mostly focused on motorized transportation and the engineering and manufacturing that make it possible. Founded in 1908 as a Holding Company for McLaughlin and Buick Stocks and allied in 1919, in Flint, Michigan, as of 2012 it employs approximately 202,000 people around the world.[1] With global headquarters at the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Michigan, United States, GM manufactures its cars and trucks in 35 countries.

It's a process I used to love to watch.  The assembly lines and the stamping plants are wonders to behold.  Not as gritty and noisy as they once were but to some like me they are mesmerizing.

Not to mention they continue to be the source of good paying jobs and tickets to the middle class.  Of course, there's a two tier wage now in the US but that's another story.

196,N-HoLI9hO0,Top 10 3D-Printed Cars - the Future of Auto Manufacturing,"3d printing is one of those disruptive technologies that might reshape our future. It is cheap, it is fast and environmentally friendly. 

While NASA plans to use 3d printers on long space missions, auto manufacturers intend to solve some more grounded tasks, like speeding up car manufacturing process, building durable and light bodies and decreasing the number of auto parts altogether. Take a glimpse at the first 10 3d printed cars that will stay in the history books forever. Enjoy the ride.

Light cocoon ‚Äì Edag: www.edag.de/en/edag/press-media/picture-archive/concept-cars.html
The German engineering company EDAG is quite ambitious to say the least, as it is set on changing the way cars are being built today. Light Cocoon is a follow up to the Genesis that was this company‚Äôs first attempts to create a 3d printed Auto body. The outer shell of the Cocoon is made of durable water resistant ultra thin fabric that is drawn over the 3d printed body made of polymer. The outfit for this car was designed in cooperation with the famous German manufacturer of sport clothes jack Wolfskin. 

Soulmate ‚Äì Edag: www.edag.de/en/edag/press-media/picture-archive/concept-cars.html
Soulmate is the latest development from Edag that was introduced in 2016. This car concept was designed in cooperation with the German company Bosch, and resulted in the creation of incredibly beautiful lightweight car with features of connected mobility.

‚ñ∫ If you love cars you should SUBSCRIBE Now to Gommeblog Car and Performance Youtube Channel: 

The BMW Group continues to focus on the implementation of its electro-mobility strategy, with the company concentrating all its technological expertise relating to battery cells at a new competence centre. 

The battery cell is the heart of the battery. It determines performance, energy content, charging capabilities and lifespan, thereby making a significant contribution to the performance of an electrified vehicle.

In the labs, research and prototyping facilities, which will make up the battery cell competence centre, specialist departments will analyse cell design and cell technology. They will also create prototypes of future battery cells, focusing on the chemical composition of the cells, use of different materials, how the cell behaves in critical or extremely cold conditions, charging and rapid-charging behaviour and evaluating cell sizes and forms. This in-house technological expertise is key to enhancing the battery, thereby enabling higher performance capabilities.

The BMW Group will also gain build-to-print expertise and can then contract out production of battery cells produced to its exact product requirements and specifications. This core competence ‚Äì which covers the entire value chain from selection of materials, cell design, integration into battery systems, manufacturability and production technologies ‚Äì gives the company a definite competitive edge, while leveraging cost benefits and economies of scale.

The BMW Group has already completed years of research into battery cells and acquired a high level of evaluation competence, especially through the development of the BMW i models. The company will concentrate know-how from various specialist departments and locations at the new Battery Cell Competence Centre and step up its efforts in this area to achieve faster impact. Research findings will be incorporated directly into the latest battery generation. 

This interdisciplinary competence centre aims to advance battery cell technology and introduce it into production processes. The company will invest a total of 200 million euros in the location over the next four years, creating 200 jobs. The centre will open in early 2019.

But, what he lacked in affluent parental background, he made up for with intelligence, hard-work, discipline and business acumen - qualities that have continued to interplay remarkably in his many ventures.

In February 2007, Chukwuma embarked on what some analysts perceived then as a mission impossible, when it incorporated INNOSON Vehicle Manufacturing Company Limited (IVM), to produce sundry commercial automobiles, utility vehicles and passenger cars, in collaboration with a consortium of Chinese auto manufacturers.
With the public display of some of the vehicles at the 2nd Nnewi International Auto Trade Fair held at the Beverly Hills Hotels (Gabros Sports Complex) in the last quarter of 2009, IVM did not only silence the critics, but made a bold statement about its readiness to achieve the avowed mission of being the first (indigenous) auto maker to produce truly Nigerian vehicles that are affordable and reliable.

IVM is today a success story which has attracted effusive commendations and awards from various quarters, including the nation's seat of power. While opening the plant on October 15, 2010, President Goodluck Jonathan not only hailed Chukwuma for the courage of venturing into an industry many ran away from, but also assured him of government's patronage from the government.

But even before the President's visit, IVM had attracted an official delegation from the Ghanaian government, which through a minister, dangled incentives before Chukwuma with an appeal to come over to Accra for talks on how he could set up a similar plant in the former Gold Coast.

224,qCbYd8O8MU,Audi Smart Factory - Future of Audi Production,"Audi Smart Factory P-Tech Day. Subscribe.
Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data ‚Äì the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data ‚Äì will facilitate data‚Äëdriven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future ‚Äì from the application of virtual‚Äëreality glasses to metal 3D printing.

Modular assembly.
The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.

Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines ‚Äì in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems ‚Äì it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.

Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Gy≈ër, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.

At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by ‚Äúarculus‚Äù ‚Äì a startup company established a few months ago.

The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.
The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechnology Development Production Assistance Systems‚Äù department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‚Äësoftware development processes.

The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.

The Audi Production Lab.
The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‚ÄëLab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process ‚Äì often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‚Äërobot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.

The projects currently running in the P‚ÄëLab include two big‚Äëdata projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future ‚Äì with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.

Toolmaking.
Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi‚Äôs Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‚Äëmetal parts.

The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‚Äëmetal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

In the running to establish electric vehicles, Tesla initially appeared to have left the rest of the car industry in the dust. But things have gotten tougher for Elon Musk‚Äôs crown jewel company. The race to dominate the market for the car of the future has entered a critical phase.

Tesla has set new standards in the automotive industry. For years, its CEO was as celebrated as any rock star. But both the boss and his company are coming under increased fire from critics. Employees have claimed working conditions at production facilities are chaotic and often questionable. Production on the Tesla assembly lines has often been brought to a standstill. Meanwhile, losses are growing, while Musk‚Äôs reputation has also become somewhat dented and scratched. Meanwhile, other major car brands are working at top speed to bump Tesla from its pole position, with Porsche leading the pack. Little is known about the German carmaker‚Äôs new electric Taycan model, but this documentary reveals just how dangerous a new electric Porsche could be for Tesla. And major carmakers have another trump card to play. They have decades of experience in the mass production of cars, while Tesla is still a newcomer to the field. The film also shows how much German technology is hidden in Tesla models, and how both Musk and new Chinese competition are betting on German expertise. The race to dominate the market for electric cars is far from over.

Audi Hungaria starts series production of electric motors. Production of electric motors is a key milestone along the way to electric mobility.

A new era is starting at Audi Hungaria. On Tuesday, series production of electric motors officially started in Gy≈ër. In the context of the symbolic act, the production plant was put into operation by P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥, Minister for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs, Peter K√∂ssler, Board of Management Member for Production and Logistics at AUDI AG, and Achim Heinfling, Managing Director of AUDI HUNGARIA Zrt. The electric motors are produced on floor space of 8,500 square meters with an innovative production concept: modular assembly. The company has invested a double digit million amount to set up the motor production facility. Approximately 100 people are employed in this new area at present.

For the production of electric motors, Audi Hungaria installed the innovative production equipment and islands within just one year. The departments for the development of electric motors and for production planning cooperated closely with the prototype manufacturing/ production technology center in Gy≈ër to develop the required expertise. The current production capacity is for approximately 400 electric axle motors each day and can be gradually increased. At present, about 100 people are employed in this new area, to be increased to more than 130 by the end of the year. Production is with one‚Äëshift operation, but will soon change to three shifts.

The electric motor from Gy≈ër offers numerous new features. With the stator ‚Äì one of the core components of the motor ‚Äì the aim is to insert as much of the thin enameled copper wire as possible into the casing: the tighter the winding, the more efficient the power delivery. A new winding and inserting center at Audi Hungaria makes it possible to wind the optimal amount of enameled copper wire particularly compactly and then insert it into the casing. The electric axle consists of other large components such as the power electronics, which are located in their own housing, the gearing and two flange shafts that transmit the power to the wheels. The employees produce two electric axle drive systems for each Audi e-tron, as both the front and rear axles are driven ‚Äì in good quattro tradition.

The production equipment, the robots and the bolting and measuring station are set out in fixed positions but are not linked together by a linear band. Instead, the employees produce the drive systems according to a modular method in production islands. Despite a predefined assembly sequence, the modular system allows branched paths and more free scope in the production process. Driverless vehicles, controlled by an intelligent IT system, transport the parts to the workstations.

In parallel to the production facility, Audi Hungaria has installed three test benches for electric motors in the engine/motor development department, for testing and continuous load operation. The employees have undergone further training to become electrical experts in the production technology center for electric motors.

Audi Hungaria produced 1,965,165 engines last year, making the company one of the world‚Äôs largest engine producers. At the plant in Gy≈ër, six different gasoline engines and three different diesel engines were produced in 2017 with power output ranging from 63 kilowatts (86 horsepower) to 470 kW (639 hp). Approximately 6,000 employees produce about 9,000 engines each day for 32 production plants of the Volkswagen Group.",Manufacturing

Nowadays they are the second most commonly found material in cars. To give you a concrete example in numbers: an average modern car weighing 1,500 kg contains about 20% of plastic materials (considering thermoplastics and elastomers). This means 300 kg distributed over 2,000 parts and components of all shapes and sizes.

Polymers have revolutionised the performance, safety, construction and functionality of cars. Parts made of plastics are resistant to corrosion, offer flexibility and resilience for added safety, have very good thermal insulation, reduce noise and allow optimum space utilization.

277,IcdxJ2Rce98,How is virtual reality applied in SEAT car manufacturing,"The world of video games provided the impetus to virtual reality in the 80s and increasingly more sectors are now using this technology, such as the automotive industry. 3D has revolutionised the way to create and develop cars in recent decades. How are these new tools applied to car manufacturing?

- Designers with Full HD glasses: These glasses enable them to immerse themselves in a driving experience that is similar to what future customers will have. Although the initial design of a new car always begins with pencil and paper, 3D technology soon comes into play. Thanks to this, designers can not only evaluate purely creative aspects, but other more functional ones as well, which ensures that 90% if the initial sketches are viable.

- 95,000 3D simulations per model: Virtual reality plays an essential role in every development stage. 95,000 simulations were performed in the case of the new SEAT Ibiza, which is twice as many as for the previous generation. Among other tests carried out, virtual collisions are staged so that future cars are safer than ever. During the approximately three and a half years of development that go into a car, up to three million elements are analysed using simulations, a figure which was limited to about only 5,000 items 30 years ago.

- 30% reduction in prototype production time: This technology has enabled to reduce by half the number of prototypes that need to be made physically prior to launching a new model. It also allows their production time to be lowered by 30%. Unlike several decades ago, today the latest tools make improvements and decision making much faster.

- More than 800 areas of improvement for each model: This reduction in time and resources in the production of a car has a direct effect on customers, not only in the precision and quality of the product, but also on lowering the final Price. In the case of the SEAT Ateca, up to 800 improvements were introduced before it went into production.

- Immersion in the virtual factory: Virtual technologies also provide an immersive experience to reproduce the real world. In this regard, by using 3D glasses and a few controls, technicians at the Prototype Development Centre imitate and analyse the movements made by workers on the assembly line in order to optimise their working time and improve workstation ergonomics.

- Dealerships of the future: Choosing a car from a catalogue will soon be a thing of the past. Thanks to virtual reality, customers can configure the trim level and colour of their vehicle and see the result by wearing 3D glasses. In addition to this, they will also be able to experience a virtual test-drive without stepping outside the dealership.

278,zX5Y33QOpNg,CAR FACTORY : NEW TOYOTA PRODUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING CENTER l Kentucky (US) l Clip,"Toyota Motor North America has the best and brightest accepting the challenge: innovate and problem solve to create the next generation of manufacturing technology. Today‚Äôs newly opened $80 million, 235,000 square foot environmentally-conscious Production Engineering and Manufacturing Center (PEMC) in Georgetown, Kentucky, is the final building constructed under the ‚ÄúOne Toyota‚Äù project, and is both a statement on Toyota‚Äôs commitment to investing in the future of American manufacturing and a home base for a key group of more than 600 Toyota engineers.

 ‚ÄúOur production engineers are at the top of their game and help shape the future of Toyota,‚Äù said Jim Lentz, chief executive officer of Toyota Motor North America. ‚ÄúThey push the limits every day on what‚Äôs possible in manufacturing to produce ever-better vehicles. And their hard work and commitment to quality shows in the products we build in our 14 plants across North America.‚Äù

A production engineer‚Äôs work begins after a vehicle concept is dreamed up, but before the product is manufactured. This key group of engineers finds the best way to make the vehicle, designing processes and layouts that make Toyota plants come to life. Supporting all aspects of production, including stamping, body, paint, plastics, assembly, powertrain, environmental, and safety, they interact with team members in vehicle design and product planning, as well as on the production floor to support everyday operations, model changes, Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) implementation, new construction and future innovations and technology.
 
The PEMC in Kentucky has capacity to house 800 team members. In addition to production engineering, supporting teams located at PEMC include indirect purchasing, information systems, strategic business management, human resources and talent development.
 
Announced three years ago as part of the ‚ÄúOne Toyota‚Äù initiative to create more unified operations in North America ‚Äì which also included the new North American headquarters for Toyota in Plano, Texas, and a new research and development facility in Ann Arbor, Mich., ‚Äì the PEMC includes leading-edge spaces that feature natural lighting, encourage discovery and foster teamwork that will result in increased collaboration and faster decision making.
 
As the manufacturing nucleus for Toyota‚Äôs North American plants, PEMC has a new TILT Lab to focus primarily on problem solving and innovation. With a name inspired by the goal of the space, the TILT Lab provides everything Toyota engineers need to shift conventional thinking on its axis, and take an idea from concept to prototype. Once tested, those advancements may be applied to the company‚Äôs plants to improve processes or solve a challenge.",Manufacturing

Introducing a new concept in sports car manufacturing, the Healy Enigma.

EQUIPMENT
Substantial space frame chassis, GRP glass fibre body with coremat layer, wing vents, double skin body panels, side skirts, Mazda MX-5 frame and material hood skin, tonneau infill panels, turbulence deflector, roll over hoops, electric windows and door mirrors, climate control, heated seats, Piano Black fascia inserts, chromed vent bezels, Enigma bright tread plates, cabin lockers, centre console, GPS/MP3 stereo system, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), Limited slip Differential (LSD).  Factory options; Mohair hood.  Dealer options; Tailored floor mats.

EXTERIOR
The bespoke body shape interpreted from the original Austin Healey 3000 displays instantly recognisable design cues such as the long sweeping bonnet, prominent front wings and elegant raked rear end, a staple sports car recipe!  This brand new Enigma registered as a company demonstrator on a 65 plate prefix has been finished in stunning Aston Martin Casino Royale Silver Pearl (code 5049).  The high quality gelcoat finish is simply gorgeous and truly stirs the senses with production quality achieved .  Excellent fit and shut lines to the double skinned panels are a testament to the maker‚Äôs insistence on high standards and the uncompromised skilled craftsmanship.  Effortless operation of the folding mohair hood takes literally seconds and the quality you would expect from Mazda is a certainty.  Careful design and selection of bodywork fittings completes the package and the resulting efforts are clear to see, a truly beautiful car with classic design cues.

INTERIOR 
The interior of this Healy Enigma MK3 will evoke familiarisation with anyone who has experienced the superb modern Mazda MX5.  Approximately ten inches wider than the MX5 on which it is based, a more spacious and touring roadster sensation is achieved.  The seats, dashboard, door cards and fixtures have all been modified or re-upholstered to harmonise perfectly with the unique Enigma body shape.  With many bespoke options to choose from, this example was specified to include sumptuous full black quilted leather with contrasting white stitching and door cards to match.  Beautifully made styling attributes such as the Piano Black fascia inserts and chromed vent bezels remain to enhance the elegance of this well appointed cabin space.  The high quality switchgear and controls are in line with production standards, and all functions in this high specification example operate accordingly.

ENGINE & TRANSMISSION
Each Enigma utilises the renowned and bulletproof Mazda MX5 engine, mechanicals and running gear.  All fully rebuilt with consumables such as the clutch, water pump and ancillary belts renewed at the Healy Designs Ltd factory.  This example is fitted with the 157bhp 1998cc four cylinder unit mated to the six speed gearbox to offer sporting performance and turn key reliability.

WHEELS, TYRES & BRAKES
Fitted with stunning brand new 18in PDW diamond cut alloy wheels and tyres, the quality aspect is never compromised with Bridgestone Potenza 215/45 R18 low profile fitment all round.  The fully refurbished braking system incorporates discs all round and ABS assistance to meet modern production car standards.

HISTORY FILE
Each Healy Enigma is assembled at the First Choice Healy Designs Ltd Factory in Riga, the capital city of Latvia.  This example was created from the donor vehicle, a low mileage Mazda MX5 Mk3 sourced from the UK and shipped over to the factory.  This hand built car as with all Enigma‚Äôs is supplied fully registered with the DVLA having been subject to the required rigorous SVA testing procedure with all paperwork included.  Registered on 1st October 2015 as the Managing Directors personal demonstrator, the mileage covered is just 1,778 miles from new and is registered as a 65 plate with the V5 stating Healy Enigma.

Since then, Innoson vehicles, mostly Sports Utility Vehicles (known more in these climes as jeeps), trucks, buses, and others, have become a common feature on Nigerian roads. The company has also made inroads into the auto markets in other African countries.

When we started, our vision was to cover the entire African continent, and we remain committed to that vision. Presently, our manufacturing plant at Nnewi is built to service the entire African continent, and gladly enough we have been meeting up with market demands. Our strategy was to plan futuristically, knowing that huge orders would come, and as it stands today, we are able to meet up with the huge demands. We have the manpower and modern technology to cope with expected challenges. Today we manufacture trucks, SUV's or what most people call jeeps. We also have buses, refuse disposal vehicles, pick-up vans and many others. It's an achievement based on experience and knowledge,"" he said. Read more...

Car manufacturers have to translate their brand values into lifestyle services as cars become a utility, which enable mobility services based on the data they generate and the features they provide. Understanding this shift will enable partnerships between brands within industries that were previously unrelated.
