Check out my blog ► http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn’t wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They’re so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi’s scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn’t have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn’t a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn’t small, but at the same time, it wasn’t huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I’d never had it before. It’s a big, crunchy kachori that’s stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It’s an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn’t contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn’t wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it’s a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don’t miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

Hi Guys,

After Surat, I was in Ahmedabad for 3 days and I started my food journey with Manek Chowk. So many of y'all suggested that I must go to Manek Chowk when I visit Ahmedabad. I was honestly taken away by surprise with the variety this night market has to offer.

From Dosa, sandwiches to Pulao and Masala Pav, I tried some of the best dishes here. 

All these dishes can be found very easily in Manek Chowk. Unfortunately, I misplaced a page where I wrote all the joint names from where I tried these dishes. However, being easily accessible, you won't find it difficult to hunt these dishes.

Let me know in the comments or mail me if you have more doubts.

Watch more Pakistani Street Food videos: https://youtu.be/bg2II5DIJ0E
Subscribe  for 2 new videos every week

Khanay Ka Scene Aala with Pepsi - “Make meals memorable with Pepsi” - First of all a huge thank you to Pepsi Pakistan for sponsoring this ultimate Western Pakistani street food tour in Pakistan, and for making it happen. It was a quick trip to Pakistan, but we had a lot of fun filming and eating a different side of Pakistani food than I tried on my first trip.

“Aala” - Just to clarify, this is a very popular expression in Pakistan and across the Indian subcontinent meaning “amazing,” or wow!

Western Pakistani street food is common, and you’ll be surprised with the fusion of creations and creativity that you’ll find. For me, part of the joy of food is being able to interact with the cooks, see the food being prepared, and then eating - and Pakistan is as good as it gets. We started in Karachi, moved to Islamabad, and finishing this whirlwind tour in Lahore. 

Here are the restaurants and street food stalls we ate at in this video:

Karachi, Pakistan

Nursery Super Burgers - This place is amazing, one of my favorites. Their beef chapli burger bun kabab and their vegetable potato patty burgers and delicious. And don’t miss out on their chutney. Price - 70 PKR ($0.50) per burger

Hanifia Hunter Beef - This is a famous place in Karachi, but for me it was a little on the plain side. Price - 160 PKR ($1.13) each

Cloud Naan - Trendy yet delicious, Cloud Naan is set up like a pizza restaurant, but using naan as a base with a host of different ingredients. I loved the Philly Cheesesteak Naan. Price - about 500 PKR ($3.54) each

Mr. Burger - Pakistan’s own fast food burger chain, Mr. Burger has a unique story, and their burger is definitely better than many fast food restaurants I’ve tried. Mr. Big combo - 450 PKR ($3.19)

Biryani Of The Seas - To wrap up this street food tour in Karachi, we ate a seafood platter at Biryani of the Seas. Total price - 5,100 PKR ($36.10) total

Islamabad, Pakistan

Najeeb Spot - Famous in Islamabad for their Afghani Burger, this is a roll up of all things deep fried, and smothered in some chutney. It’s one of those 2 am foods. Price - about 200 PKR ($1.42) each

Burger Fest - Islamabad is known throughout Pakistan for their burgers, and Burger Fest is one of the best. Delicious burger. Beef Binda - 590 PKR ($4.18)

Doka Mocca Restaurant - To wrap up Islamabad we ate the supreme fries and crazy panini at Doka Mocca.

Lahore, Pakistan

Lahore Broast - My first time to try Pakistani broast, which is essentially fried chicken. The ½ Chicken Broast was good, but I really liked the degi chargha, steamed chicken with spices. Price - 290 PKR ($2.05)

Bun Plaster - Finally, another one of my favorites from this entire Western Pakistani street food fast food tour is the Lahore bun plaster. And yes, it does get its name from a wall.

Yousaf Falooda Shop - Legendary in Lahore for their milk based desserts, we tried some of their specialties, plus a Doodh Pepsi - Milk Pepsi - which is common in Pakistan.

And that wraps up this entire Western Pakistani street food tour!

At first, I thought it was biryani, but it's actually Pulao!! It was full of chickpeas!

Karachi street food is VERY delicious and famous for food lovers! In this street food video, I'm starting out by exploring burns road and finding a famous Chicken chargha, WHOLE chicken coated in masala and spice and deep fried in the richest, darkest oil. I bought a whole chicken and packed it up in a bag and kept exploring the deep back alleys near burns road for more famous Pakistani street food.

After this, I found an alleyway selling thousands and thousands of unique street foods, right off of Burns road in Karachi. I stopped at the first and most busiest stall I saw, selling famous Pakistani pakoras, samosas, jalebi desserts, and more. I ordered a few of the best street foods I saw and tried to pay but no one would accept my payment!

11,GMPh6t-lwjM,"Indian STREET FOOD Tour at Night - Momos, Vada Pav & Chicken Tandoori | Jorhat, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ► http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ► http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

One of the things I love the most about travel is that destinations are never just one thing. They’re multi-layered and diverse. A prime example of that is India, a country I’ve now visited three times. The states of Assam and Meghalaya in northeast India, which I explored in March of 2019, are so different from other parts of the country, from the people to the culture to the landscapes to the food. It’s so exciting to get more of a sense of what India is and I’m thrilled to share this gorgeous and unique region with you!

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

My first night in the Assamese city of Jorhat continued as my friend Rishi and I headed out on a nighttime street food tour I will never forget! Jorhat is very close to China, so there are lots of Chinese and even Mongolian influences in the cuisine there. I couldn’t wait to taste them for myself!

First, we headed to Break Time to get some momos. These momos are steamed first and then fried. A rich and spicy red sauce with pepper and chilies is made and the momos are stir-fried with it. These momos weren’t too hot and I loved the red sauce! They were the best fried momos I’d ever had. They were still crunchy on the outside and super juicy in the middle. The chicken inside was minced and perfectly cooked. They’re super filling and were like spicy, Szechwan-inspired momos. I was in love with them! You get a massive plate of them for only 60 rupees, or roughly $0.86 U.S.

Next, we headed back out and got some Vada Pav at Delhi Chaat House. Vada Pav is a potato fritter that is served on a bun with chutneys and is sometimes referred to as an Indian burger. I’d had it before in Mumbai and Pune and couldn’t wait to try it again. It was served with mustard, sweet sauce, coriander chutney, and a spicy sauce. The sweet sauce was so tasty. The bun was super fluffy and the spicy sauce was really hot! I also loved the coriander chutney. It was an amazing potato mash sandwich! It only cost about 40 rupees, or about $0.58 U.S.  

After that, we continued our street food tour by heading back out and getting some spicy chicken wings at Seev’s. They use the second spiciest peppers in the world, ghost peppers, in their wings. There was a honey glazed sauce on it that contained the peppers. The chicken wasn’t that hot but was super juicy. The heat made my lips tingle a little bit as I continued eating.

We also got some double-marinated chicken tandoori drumsticks, which had a thick, white sauce on them. I loved the smoky flavor and the glaze was so creamy and cheesy. I was in love with them! I added some mint chutney to them which was great. The sauce was like a soft brie cheese. Our total there came to 450 rupees ($6.49 U.S.): 250 ($3.60 U.S.) for the wings and 200 ($2.88 U.S.) for the tandoori drumsticks.

Next, we were back on the streets of Jorhat to get some spicy pani puri! Pani Puri is my favorite Indian dish of all time and my mouth was all set for a spicy version of it! They’re made of leavened, hollow flatbread that is filled with an aloo (potato) mixture, chilies, onions, pani (spiced water), and a spicy sauce. It was super hot and really good. I loved the crunch and chunks of potato. I’d never had pani puri this spicy! It costs 10 rupees ($0.14 U.S.) for 5 puris and the vendor keeps giving you more until you say you’re done.

The vendor also gave me a dry one without pani that I liked even better! I could honestly eat pani puri forever. The dry ones without the pani were so fantastic! I loved them so much. They were both spicy and sweet and had an incredible flavor combination. And even though it’s 10 rupees for 5, the vendor actually gives you an extra one for free!

Our final destination was Ice Station, where we got some rose lassi. I hadn’t had lassi in a while and I wanted to cool my mouth off after the spicy pani puri. It was delicious and milky and more like a shake. They put nuts on top, which add a nice crunch. I’d had a thicker lassi in Amritsar but I really liked this one, too. It had a nice rose flavor and helped me beat the fiery feeling in my mouth, so it did the trick! 

I hope you loved my nighttime street food tour of Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment. Also, please subscribe to my channel.

13,rOAbYFdNQE,"The Ultimate DUBAI FOOD TOUR - Street Food and Emirati Cuisine in Dubai, UAE!","Check out this amazing food in Dubai, UAE!
Peyman’s Channel► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2S...
Subscribe for 2 new videos per week► 

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (). He’s from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman’s home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it’s a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it’s a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that’s traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it’s awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman’s house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you’ll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It’s a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I’m a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Again, thank you to Oh My Media Malaysia for taking us around:

►Subscribe - http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts - https://migrationology.com/store/

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you’ll find in this video:

Zürich, Switzerland

Café Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I’ve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossmünster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn’t realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Zürcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It’s quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don’t want  to miss when you’re in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with unbelievably delicious bone marrow!

After this, we're going Foodrangin' and finding some local street stalls before going to Nisar Charsi Tikka BBQ Mutton HEAVEN!

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

28,YvlYjLPgrCE,Street Food in Ghana - GIANT CHOP-BAR LUNCH and West African Food Tour in Accra!,"This was an incredible day of street food in Ghana!
►Check out Jay: https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/
►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: 
►T-shirts and caps available now: 

Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She’s a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she’s incredible. Check out her Instagram () and YouTube (). 

Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here’s all the amazing food we ate:

Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What’s key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!
Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)

Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.
Coconut toffee
Tigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)
Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)
Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)

Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.
Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)

This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra. Many thanks to Jay!

This experience is not for the weak-hearted for here you will have people hogging with a greedy craving for almost everything Mohammed Ali Road has to offer in food. But if you are a first-timer, we’d suggest you pick the best out of the best which are shown in the video.",Food

38,OyxWVJQUC18,World Famous Hyderabadi CHICKEN BIRYANI | Biryani MAKING & Tasting,"The Hyderabadi Biryani needs no detailed introduction. This glorious delicacy is a staple for the locals and the go-to dish for the tourists. Hyderabadi Biryani is characteristically distinct from its popular counterparts because of its distinct aroma, taste, texture and the mode of preparation.

With the essence of Turkish, Mughlai and Arabic influences in it, the Hyderabadi Biryani has been an integral part of the Hyderabad’s culinary tradition since a long time. In this culinary exploration, we have set out to savour the dazzling aura of this majestic dish at some of the most famed destinations across the city. We are happy to be accompanied by our gracious host Sankalp Vishnu who is an acclaimed food critic and food expert.

We tried Hyderabadi biryani at two eminent places-The Lucky restaurant and the Bawarchi restaurant. Our intention was to understand the nuances or fine tuning of the variations in the Hyderabadi biryani as adopted by these joints. 

Our first stop was the Lucky restaurant that serves one of the best versions of the Kachi Gost Ki Biryani. We got the opportunity to witness the making of a batch of Hyderabadi Biryani at their wonderful, aromatic kitchen. The seemingly easy procedure entails an astute understanding of the dynamics of its cooking, perseverance and dexterity. The genial owner for Lucky restaurant walked us through the process sharing all the details of their prized preparation. We then tried the Nalli Biryani along with some other delectable meaty wonders. The feast ended with the lusciously amazing Khubani ka Meetha a dessert that’s exclusive to the city.

The next day we went to the acclaimed Bawarchi restaurant to try their version of the Hyderabadi Biryani. In recent years it has emerged as favourite destination for the same. The beautifully done Chicken Biryani was worth all the reputation. It ticked all the boxes of parameters that make the magic of a biryani work. A distinct feature of the biryani here was the pleasantly notable presence of the shah jeera flavour in it. Here we also tried the Hyderabad famous Double Ka Meetha and the Kaddu ka kheer. The latter one was the best.
 
While winding up this Hyderabadi biryani trail we couldn’t but wonder at the flamboyant stature of this apparently royal dish that rules the heart of the masses in and beyond this city.

 We are truly grateful to Sankalp Vishnu for his cooperation.

47,2RBRUF,Indonesian Street Food Tour of Glodok (Chinatown) in Jakarta - DELICIOUS Indonesia Food!,"►Check out 50 of the Best Indonesian Dishes: https://migrationology.com/indonesian...

Glodok is the Chinatown of Jakarta, and my wife and I decided to spend the day walking around Glodok and exploring some Indonesian street food throughout the day. At the end of the day, we also stopped by Fatahillah Square, with is an old Dutch square in colonial Jakarta, where you'll find some interesting buildings and some street food snacks as well.

Since we were staying at a hotel (here’s information on the hotel I stayed at:)  not too far from Glodok, we decided to beat the traffic and just walk over there. It didn’t take more than 15 minutes to walk, and soon we arrived in Jakarta’s Chinatown. Glodok is a very interesting area to walk around and explore. There are fresh markets and plenty of restaurants and food to choose from.

The Indonesian street food I tried on this tour was siomay, an Indonesian Chinese dish. From the back of a motorbike, I chose a few of the siomay dumplings he had steaming, and the cut them up and added some peanut sauce to the plate. The texture was a little mushy, but they were alright. Right opposite the siomay, the owner of an Indonesian vegetarian restaurant greeted me and asked if I might like to eat some of his vegetarian food. His vegetarian rendang was particularly good.

One of the most famous places to go in Glodok is Kopi Es Tak Kie, a legendary coffee shop. After wandering around a while we found it. I had a cup of coffee and also a plate of nasi campur from outside the shop.

We continued on our Indonesian street food tour throughout Glodok and I tried a sweet snack called kue ape, which is a green colored little pancake. Next, I had a variety of deep fried snacks including fried bananas, and fried breadfruit. They are definitely pretty greasy, but interesting to sample, and they are very popular street food snacks in Indonesia.

It probably wasn’t the greatest idea to walk, but we decided to walk over to Fatahillah Square. The traffic was pretty intense, but we made it. And along with checking out the old colonial buildings one of my main goals was to try kerak telor, which is a traditional Indonesian Betawi street food snack. Luckily I found it and it turned out to be a very interesting and amazing snack to watch being made!

Here’s the list of the things we ate and the prices:

Siomay - 15,000 IDR ($1.11)
Vegetarian food - 20,000 IDR ($1.48)
Kopi Es Tak Kie - 10,000 IDR ($0.73) 
Nasi campur - 35,000 IDR ($2.58)

Kue ape - 1,000 IDR ($0.07) each
Fried snacks - 12,000 ($0.88)
Kerak telor - 20,000 IDR ($1.48) - Possibly overcharged? Do you think?

Hope you enjoyed the Indonesian street food tour of Glodok and Fatahillah Square, I sure enjoyed eating it!

Street Food in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro!    

Ever since I first learned about the city of Rio de Janeiro when I was a kid growing up, I have wanted to visit. Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we’ll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited.

Here’s the Brazilian food and things we did:

Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He’s not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you’re in Rio de Janeiro, you don’t want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: ), sets up in the morning about 7 am.

Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.

Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn’t going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.

Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: 

Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.

Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar).

Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you’ll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that’s famous for serving empada de camarão (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening. Location: 

Bar Gato de Botas - A Brazilian boteco is a bar and restaurant that serves small plates of food similar to tapas. The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious. Location: 

Brazilian meat kebabs - Finally to end this incredible street food tour of Rio de Janeiro, we returned back to the same spot where we had breakfast, but in the evening, a different yet equally friendly man sets up selling Brazilian meat kebas and home cooked Brazilian food. When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good. Location:  Sets up in the evening about 6 pm.

Rio de Janeiro is a beautiful city and this Brazilian street food tour and attraction in Rio was amazing - the food, the people, the scenery.

During the fourteenth century the Renaissance started in Italy, and slowly spread throughout Europe. As shown in this episode, the refreshing Renaissance era indicates an intellectual, philosophical, artistic and religious revolution and is mainly influenced by humanism. The objective of this movement to improve humanity also had its effect on the kitchen and dinner table. Strict table manners and consumption of imported vegetables are examples of the many culinary changes discussed in the episode.

There are few cities in the world that can compare to Jerusalem in terms of ancient history and religious significance. It’s one of the most fascinating cities in the world, and it’s a city that I’ve wanted to visit my entire life. Finally, along with my friend David () and Rafram, we explored Jerusalem to discover the food treasures the city has to offer - and let me tell you, you’ll find some incredibly delicious food in Jerusalem!
 
We started off the Jerusalem food tour by first walking around East Jerusalem and starting with the best plate of hummus I’ve ever had. We then toured around Old Jerusalem, and enjoyed some incredible Palestinian food kebabs cooked by an incredible man who cooked with serious love and passion. Another highlight in Jerusalem was the mutabak, a thin  pastry stuffed with cheese and baked.

After eating our way through Old Jerusalem, we then headed into West Jerusalem and went to lunch at an Israeli Jewish restaurant serving a mix of amazing dishes. The food was home-cooked in style, and absolutely sensation. A few more snacks and sightseeing throughout the afternoon, and that brought us all the way to dinner where David had made reservations to eat at one of the hottest restaurants in Jerusalem, Machneyuda Restaurant. It was quite an experience, and an amazing meal and lively atmosphere to wrap up this ultimate Jerusalem food tour.

Here’s all the food and places included in this Palestinian food and Israeli food tour of Jerusalem:

Hummus Acramawi
Price - 20 ILS ($5.57) per plate

Almond juice - 3.90 ILS ($1.09)

Al-shuala Grill Restaurant

Western Wall (Wailing Wall)
Western Wall Tunnel
Price - 35 ILS ($9.76) per person

Total price - 700 ILS ($195.21)

It was a lot of food in a single day, but it was one of the greatest food and learning days that I’ve ever had in my life. The generosity of the people we connected with, paired with the food, was truly a memorable experience in Jerusalem.

Thank you again to David () and Rafram for showing me some of the best food in Jerusalem!

►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: 

Petchaburi Soi 5 (เพชรบุรี ซอย 5) has long been one of my go-to street food streets in Bangkok. Starting in the evening at around 4 pm, the entire road starts to fill with street food carts selling all sorts of Thai dishes. You’ll find everything from rice and curry to soup noodles, snacks, and fresh fruits and vegetables. It had been a few years since I had explore Petchaburi Soi 5 (เพชรบุรี ซอย 5), so in this Thai street food tour I’m taking you with me to some of my old favorites, and some new spots. Enjoy!

Yam mama (ยำมาม่า) - 50 THB ($1.52) - This is the first dish I tried. MAMA are Thai instant noodles and this is a completely different way to eat them - in mixed salad form.

Khanom krok (ขนมครก) - 30 THB ($0.92) - Coconut griddle cakes are one of my favorites, they are crunchy on the outside and gooey in the center. Don’t miss this Thai street food snack.

Cha yen (ชาเย็น) - 25 THB ($0.76) per cup - Thai tea

Pad thai (ผัดไทย), Hoy tod (หอยทอด) - This was formerly a street food cart that now has their own permanent shophouse location. They make pretty decent Pad Thai and they hoy tod, which in this case in a mussels omelet, is pretty good as well.
Total price - 125 THB ($3.81)

Nam prik pla too (น้ำพริกปลาทู) - For something a little healthier, I’m a huge fan of nam pirk pla too, a pounded chili mackerel sauce that’s eaten with vegetables.
Total price - 70 THB ($2.14) for everything

Chao guay (เฉาก๋วย) - 25 THB ($0.76) - For dessert, I had grass jelly with ice. The owner was so friendly and happy.

Haircut - 100 THB ($3.05)

Pad kra prao moo krob kai dao (ผัดกระเพราหมูกรอบไข่ดาว) - Final meal of this Bangkok street food tour, I headed across the street to Petchaburi Soi 10 to seek out one of my old time favorites. The stall was still there, and they make a pretty good plate of Thai crispy pork belly fried with basil.
Price - 40 THB ($1.22)

Thank you for joining me on this Thai street food tour of Petchaburi Soi 5 (เพชรบุรี ซอย 5). It’s the type of street you can walk through and just choose whatever you like to eat.

Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil - From Curitiba we continued our food trip in Brazil to Goiânia in the state of Goiás, Brazil. It was a day of unique fruits, most specifically the pequi fruit, unlike any other natural unprocessed food I’ve ever tried in my life.   

Mercado Central de Goiânia - We began at the central market, where we walked around first, before trying a number of empadão, one of the main snacks to eat - a little dough pie filled with a variety of ingredients. It was delicious and hearty, especially when topped with some of the house made hot sauce. Price - 32 BRL ($7.93) for all

Exotic fruit - There was a jungle exotic Brazilian fruit shop where we sampled a few fruits like jatoba, before continued on this Brazilian food tour.

CIDADE DE GOIÁS - The main goal of the day was to drive to the historical city of Goiás, about 2 hours from Goiânia. The drive was beautiful and it was nice to see some of the countryside.

Restaurante Braseiro - But by far the highlight of the day was eating at Restaurante Braseiro, an extremely friendly and traditional Brazilian food restaurant. When we arrived I could already sense the love coming from the restaurant, and I loved the way they cooked the food, all over fire in the kitchen buffet style. The day we arrived they hadn’t cooked pequi fruit, but when we arrived and said was had come specifically to eat it, they cooked it for us. Pequi is a very unique and slightly bizarre fruit from this region of Brazil. It can be dangerous because of the spikes in the center - so don’t bite too deep. But the flavor is unlike any other fruit I’ve ever had, almost like cheddar cheese. Price - 20 BRL ($4.95) per person

Banca da Pamonha - When we got back to the city, we continued with a few Brazilian street food snacks, including pamonha, which is the local version of a tamale. I was impressed how good they were. Price - 26 BRL ($6.44) for 3

Boteco do Zé do Abílio - Finally to end this Brazilian food tour, we went to Boteco do Zé do Abílio to have some serious meat. Total price - 118 BRL ($29.23)

It was an amazing day in Brazil, and especially a regional Brazilian food learning experience.

Talad Rot Fai (ตลาดนัดรถไฟ), also known as the Train night market in Bangkok, or Talad Rot Fai in Thai, is one of the most popular night markets in Bangkok - this branch located at Ratchada. Here’s a map link: 

By the way, this is Part 2 of this Night Market Thai street food tour. You can watch the gigantic tom yum challenge here: 

The market is known for its unique Thai street food, some of the snacks and dishes which are invented there and you won’t find anywhere else in Bangkok.

Laeng Saeb (เล้งแซ่บ) at Diaw Maekhlong Restaurant (ร้านเตี๋ยวแม่กลอง) - Laeng saeb, a dish of pork bones and ridiculous amounts of green chilies is one of the most popular Thai street food inventions at Talad Rot Fai, and this is mainly what I came to eat. The restaurant is located at the back of the market, and they have a few different sizes you can choose from.

XXL Laeng Saeb (เล้งแซ่บ) - Price - 599 THB ($18.96) - We went straight for the XXL size, a massive platter of pork bones, soup, insane amounts of green chilies and the soup broth. Of all the Thai street food I’ve eaten, this is one of the most unbelievable and insanely giant street foods of Thailand I’ve ever seen or eaten. Although it’s way more than I ever care to eat again in one sitting, it’s actually a really good dish.

Crispy butter (เนยกรอบ) - 35 THB ($1.11)
Stir fried ice cream (ไอติมผัด) - 69 THB ($2.18)
Coconut shake (น้ำมะพร้าวปั่น) - 35 THB ($1.11)

And that completed this Thai street food night market tour of Talad Rot Fai. It’s well worth a visit, and you can of course, order smaller sizes of laeng saeb when you’re in Bangkok. Enjoy!

►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: 
►T-shirts available now: 

Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours:  for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.

Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!

Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:

Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn’t eat that much of it.

Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.

Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there’s a version that’s comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.

Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. 

Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.

Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I’ve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.
Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.

Jacuzzi braised ½ chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.

Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.

Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.

Special thanks to Zouba Tours () for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.

That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan. If you haven’t already, watch the full series here:

We are introduced to Louisiana-style vegan food from King of Kings Plant Based Cuisine that has both Cliff and MGK rethink what it means to live on a plant-based diet. They then sample some traditional NOLA-style steak and salmon dishes from @nolatopchef that are so good Machine Gun Kelly gets violent. 

Chop it up with chef Cliff Skighwalker on our new series “InstaChef”! Cliff and his celebrity friends tour the country to take a deep dive into the underground food scene. There’s a network of chefs in America who are delivering food to people strictly through Instagram. Folks cook food in their house, post what they’re making on Instagram, and sell it to customers who come by. And these people aren’t trend-seeking foodies taking vanity glamour shots on Instagram, but former line cooks, restaurant workers, and home chefs taking success into their own hands to make a better life for themselves and their family.

►T-shirts and caps available now: 
►Check out my Nairobi travel guide: 

Thank you for watching this ultimate Kenyan street food tour in Nairobi! I met up with my friend James who took me around to a few of his favorite spots to eat.

Kawangware, Nairobi, Kenya

Here's most of the food we tried on this amazing tour of Nairobi:

Ann Restaurant - Dagoretti Corner - This small street food stall on Dagoretti Corner in Nairobi serves all sorts of Kenyan / East African foods. Their chapatis are especially good, and their Lake Victoria  sardines fried with tomatoes.
Chapati
Dagaa - Lake Victoria sardine
Matumbo - stomach stew
Githeri - beans and maize
The guy sitting across the table - “you should not eat beans and sardines together, or you’ll have gas.”
Total bill - 1,050 KES ($10.39) - we paid for 4 or 5 guys eating there

Stomach Clinix -  This was  the best  food stop of the day, a neighborhood meat shop that James took me to that specializes in cow head soup. The grilled tongue was also spectacular, but the soup was the best.
Total price - 200 KES ($1.98)

Dagoretti Market -  After the meat, we took a walk over to Dagoretti Market. After browsing around for a while, we stopped for another plate of mixed Kenyan food, mostly dengu, which are mung beans. It was simple, but quite good.
Dengu - mung beans
Total price - 300 KES ($2.97)

Unity Cafe Hotel - We met up with some of James' friend in Kawangware, and went to eat across the street from their shoe shop. The mandazi mix was the highlight of this Kenyan meal.
Total price - 600 KES ($5.94) for all

Cow foot fry - Next we headed over to Oscar who makes cow food soup, fry and boil. He was a very friendly man, and showed me his entire process of making cow foot soup. It was delicious!
Total price - 450 KES ($4.45)

Kenyan street food - To end this Kenyan street food tour of Nairobi we had to eat one of the ultimate Kenyan fast food meat treats. You'll see these types of grills all over the streets in the late afternoon throughout Nairobi. You just choose what you want, it's cut on the chopping board, and you stand and eat.
Esophagus
Intestines
Mutura - minced meat sausage
Mutura - blood sausage
Udder
Total price - 200 KES ($1.97)

Thank you for watching this ultimate Nairobi street food tour!

86,S2UBy8bkgyE,What Japanese Prison Food is Like ★ ONLY in JAPAN,"Japan has some amazing prison food, which should be no surprise. Inmates are served healthy, nutritious meals of grilled fish, salads, rice and soup - which are actually healthier than most school lunches around the world! Would you like to try what prisoners eat? There's a prison in Hokkaido that serves authentic meals to the public and that is where I went -- Abashiri. 

Abashiri is in the very north of Hokkaido and is famous for its prison. Their ""Bangaichi Shokudo Diner"" is the only restaurant that serves authentic prison food in Japan, the ingredients the same as the penitentiary nearby. The meals will probably surprise you! 

Prison Food Menu:

It's called the ""secret meal"" because Japanese Prisons are very restrictive with access to the outside world. However, Abashiri is dfferent and they've opened up prison life to the public and it's worth a visit. 

We also get a tour of today's prison cells in Japan. They have tatami mats, futons, TV, toilet and window. There are private cells and cells for 6 or more inmates. Japanese inmates typically eat their meals in their cells. 

The Japanese prison life is regimented, the schedule the same everyday. Wake up at 6:40am and lights out at 9:00pm. 
Meal time is three times a day for 20 minutes. 

Where is Abashiri, Japan? 
It's in Hokkaido's north, a 90 plane ride from Tokyo's Haneda Airport.

Thank you for watching! I normally cook a meal like this for Kohaku once a year on his birthday, but since I got a lot of requests to make a food for him, I decided to make this video. I’m going to make meals for human from next time. If you want to make a meal for your cats, please do research on which ingredients are okay to use. Also, make sure not to feed too much nor too often since it’s difficult to make a meal that are nutritious enough for cats.  The recipe for this video is below. Thank you for watching! =^・ｪ・^=

►EQUIPMENT I use in my channel you can buy online (Amazon affiliates links) 

Chef Knife: Sekimagoroku Gyuto  ()

Chef & Utility Knife: Zwilling twin fin ()

Bob Kramer 8” Damascus Chef Knife ()

Camera: Panasonic Lumix FZ-1000 ()

【Ingredients I used*】
*Please do research on which ingredients are okay and not okay to use, how much and how often to feed when you make one for your cats. 

Sea bream 
Salmon
Chicken tender (or chicken breast) 
Yellow Fin Tuna 
Bonito Stock Soup
Catnip powder

1. Boil all the meat and fish for about a minute or two until they’re cooked. 
2. Put them in a cold water and cool them down.
3. Chop them into tiny pieces.
4. Put the paste in a round mold (or a cup if you don't have a mold!)
5. Add bonito stock soup and sprinkle some catnip powder. 

[Note]
・Do not use fatty part of fish and/or chicken since it’ll have too many calories. 
・Try giving a tiny piece of cooked fish or chicken to your cat to see if he/she will like it and won’t have problems digesting before making an actual meal.
・Again, please do research on your own.",Food

» THE SEAFOOD

1. DOMANNAKA: Mackerel Sashimi + Uni (Sea Urchin) + Dancing Tiger Shrimp 
ADDRESS: 101-0025 Tokyo, Chiyoda, Kanda Sakumacho 3-37-4 
OPEN: 4PM - 12AM 

🦐 Domannaka is based in Hokkaido, Tokyo, with 6 locations across the city. They are known for their unique dishes, primarily seafood served while it is still alive. They offer delicacies such as squid, mackerel and trevally. We tried their living mackerel sashimi, uni (sea urchin) and dancing tiger shrimp.

💸PRICE: Mackerel (saba) 8.59 USD/6,980 JPY for whole fish | Uni (sea urchin) USD/2,500 JPY per plate (13-20 sea urchins) | Tiger Shrimp (odorigui) USD/890 JPY per shrimp
----
2. TAKAMARU FRESH FISH STORE: Oyster + Ankimo (Monkfish Liver) + Anko Nabe (Monkfish Hotpot) + Deep Fried Monkfish 
ADDRESS: 950-1 Oshimata | Seven Park Ario KAshiwa 1F, Kashiwa 277-0922, Chiba Prefecture 
OPEN: 11AM - 9PM

🐟Takamaru Fresh Fish Store serves some of Tokyo’s finest fish delicacies. Among their delicacies is monkfish, a very rare fish that is hard to find in Tokyo, even in big fish markets. Monkfish liver (ankimo) is typically considered the tastiest part of the fish and was even listed on CNN’s 2011 list of the World’s 50 Most Delicious Foods. We were fortunate enough to get a taste of this dish, which is not a typical menu item at Takamaru Fresh Fish Store. Monkfish hotpot is a bit more common than monkfish liver, frequently eaten during the winter months in Japan.

96,HkrujiUig,20 MUST-KNOW FOOD HACKS FOR SUMMER,"REFRESHING FRUIT HACKS FOR KIDS

Hello, everyone! Congratulations, summer is finally here, and we prepared a lot of amazing refreshing hacks for you and your friends. Watch this video up to the end and throw the coolest fruit party ever!

One of the important things on any party that most people forget about is order. We have a few no-mess solutions for you that may come in handy when you throw a party indoors or outdoors. You can use a sheet as a tablecloth. You can use glasses for sauces for chips. If you want to keep your drinks nice and cool throughout the party without making a mess, use frozen balloons filled with water. You can reuse them after they melt, just freeze them again.

Decor is also very important. You can decorate glasses for drinks using turmeric, sprinkles, or sugar. Dip a rim of a glass in lemon juice and then dip it into any of the things mentioned above.

There are many amazing watermelon hacks in this video. You can make a cool no-bake watermelon cake and surprise your guests with your creativity. Another awesome idea is serving watermelon pops, they are very comfortable to eat.

There are many cool potato ideas in this video. You can make potato cupcakes or hurricane potatoes. Only your imagination is your limit!

Tacos Joven - They are known for their tacos de canasta, which are basket tacos, famous in Mexico City. They are served from a basket, and they keep hot the entire day as they are served. The highlight here was the chicharrón taco with chicharrón salsa.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria El Abanico - This is Lalo’s favorite restaurant in Mexico City for carnitas, the wildly popular braised pork taco. The entire rib in my taco was the highlight, so tender and flavorful.
Price - 20 MXN ($1.08) per taco

El Pescadito de Sonora - Originating from Hermosillo in Sonora, El Pescadito serves Mexican seafood tacos, especially shrimp or marlin tacos. Their tacototo is a taco that will change your life. This was as good as food gets for me.
Price - 35 MXN ($1.89) per taco

Tacos Charly - When it comes to Mexican street food, suadero is one of the greatest, a massive pan of slow braising beef in its juices. When you order your tacos, they slice up the meat, dip your tortilla in the fat, and you eat it with onions, cilantro, and salsa - pure meat heaven.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Taqueria Los Güeros - Tacos de tripa, intestines, are very popular in Mexico City as well. They may not be the most pretty tacos, but they are immensely flavorful and have all sorts of different textures going on in your mouth.
Price - 13 MXN ($0.70) per taco

Tacos Los Juanes - This is a great Mexican street food restaurant in Mexico City that serves all sorts of different tacos. We came for the tacos de cabeza and tacos de lengua, both of which were fantastic
Price - 10 MXN ($0.54) per taco

El Vilsito - For Mexican street food in Mexico City, the ultimate taco, the most loved by everyone is no doubt, Al Pastor. Cooked in the vertical spit, a technique brought over from Lebanese immigrants, Al Pastor is usually made with marinated pork that’s juicy and flavorful it might make you weep tears of joy. Lalo and I ordered, not just your ordinary tacos de al pastor, but the King of all tacos, the Gringa!
Price - 50 MXN ($2.70) each

Thanks again to Lalo from La Ruta de la Garnacha: 

This was the greatest taco day of my life. Thank you for watching!

109,CgPXS7K0hJ4,"These 8 ""Healthy"" Foods are Making You Fat!","Get ripped in 90 days - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workouts
Subscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMW

Eating healthy is a requirement if you want to get ripped and lose body fat fast.  The problem is, often times foods masquerade themselves as healthy when they are anything but.  In this video, I show you how to spot the 8 biggest healthy foods making you fat.  We call these trap foods because they sneak up on you when you least expect it.

I don’t care how much you are training or working out, if you refuse to get your nutrition in check you will never look as lean as you should or could.  Proper nutrition and good food choices are required to get ripped.  What I hate however is when you are misled into thinking that certain foods should be in your diet because they are “healthy”.  You blindly trust the guidance and then wind up frustrated when you aren’t seeing the results for your efforts.  In order to fix this once and for all, you simply have to educate yourself about these traps so you can avoid them in favor of better choices.

First up is guacamole.  Recently, I did a video on how the healthy fats in avocado are great for your body.  The problem is, people confuse healthy foods for lean foods.  Packing a huge calorie wallop with every tablespoon, we tend to overlook the impact eating this food can quickly have on our waistline by eating almost 10-12 tablespoons per serving on average.  Sure, healthy fats are healthy, but like anything else…eaten in excess you will quickly run into trouble with them.

Low fat or lite versions of foods are often way worse than the full fat, regular versions.  Beyond the fact that they usually just do a sugar for fat swap, you’re also getting a bunch of chemicals thrown in to these highly processed foods that you probably want to avoid all together.

Now I know a lot of people like to have their morning glass of OJ or other fruit juice, but if you are looking to get ripped then you are far better off opting for water and getting your fruit in solid form.  The amount of sugars packed into these “healthy” drinks is astounding.  In fact, you are likely to find that a comparison between them and a glass of soda yield almost the same amount.  Add in the fact that liquid calories are far too easy to consume (and don’t provide the fiber benefits of the solid forms) and you’ve got another reason to avoid these.

Sushi is supposed to be a healthy food option that packs a protein punch in the process.  Not so fast.  In fact, with just a sliver of fish in every piece, you’re getting just 15% protein and instead packing in the starchy carbs with enough sticky rice to hold a small fort together!  Add in the sodium IV drip you’re getting from your “low sodium” soy sauce and you’ve just made another perfect trap food.  Opt for the sashimi instead and you’ll get what you thought you were getting when you iniitally decided on having sushi.

There’s something about the word granola that just sounds so healthy.  Maybe it’s that it sounds like the word grain?  Whatever the case, you can’t ignore the fact that this is made up of calorically dense ingredients that just won’t play well in an attempt to lose fat.  If you don’t make it yourself then you’re going to be guaranteeing yourself a ton of sugar and syrup as well, as both are needed to hold all of this “goodness” together.

There are more trap foods not covered here in the description but you will find in this video.  You want to be sure if you are not avoiding them all together that you are at least educated about their pitfalls so you can limit them in your diet when you are trying to get and stay lean.  If you are looking for a complete meal plan to help you get ripped and stay ripped step by step, be sure to head to  and get the ATHLEAN-X Training System.

Chinese Street Food Islam - Muslim Chinese Street Food - Street Food China
I made my way to Lanzhou, in search of the best Chinese street food and halal Chinese muslim food. I found a ton of street food and specialty halal snacks. Lanzhou is in the northwest of China, close to the far west Xinjiang province, and is home of the Hui people, and the food is fantastic! There was a lot of Chinese street food and Islam muslim Chinese cuisine. Just like you, I love street food around the world, and I travel for food. I came here to eat!

Street food in China is something I'm always looking to find more of! So I flew to Lanzhou, China and have been trying Chinese Muslim Hui Halal Street food non stop. Best Street Food in China I've tasted! The Chinese food is so good in Lanzhou! I've eaten street food in Bejing, street food in Shanghai, street food in Chengdu, and street food in Hong Kong, all of which has been amazing, but I have to say that the chinese street food in Lanzhou has been some of the best! 

When you think of China, you probably don't think of Islam and Halal food, but that's exactly what you'll find in the Northwest. I made my way for a  food trip to the dusty and bustling classic Silk Road city of Lanzhou specifically to try the unique halal food of the Hui people. This is the side of China not many people see, and I came here to have an authentic travel experience through food.  I found a lot of food reminiscent of countries further west, with insane amounts of lamb and beef leaving me absolutely speechless. 

Here are the addresses for the places I ate Chinese Hui Muslim Halal Street Food of in Lanzhou, China. You can show a taxi driver these addresses and he will bring you there:
 
Amazing Hand Pulled Noodles 兰州七里河北滨河中路2168号 -吾穆勒蓬灰牛肉面

150,9w8sK58x,Food for warriors: Making ‘Kulesh’ in a WWII field kitchen - Taste of Russia Ep.2,"More films about food and cooking: https://rtd.rt.com/tags/food-and-cook...
Necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention and that’s true of many traditional dishes around the world. Once created for lack of better options, some foods win hearts – and stomachs – because they taste great and are easy to make. A good example is kulesh, a millet dish known as ‘warrior food’ because it can easily be cooked on an open fire. It was the staple dish for Soviet soldiers during World War II, and a modified version is prepared in Russian homes to this day.

To learn to make authentic Soviet army kulesh, Oscar and Glen join a group of military reenactors at the famous Khatenki airfield, where the legendary French Normandie-Niemen Fighter Aviation Regiment lived and worked side by side with Russian mechanics.

After chopping vegetables for the dish and wood for fuel, they spark up a real World War II military field kitchen and begin to assemble the ingredients. To Glen’s surprise, they include canned meat compliments of Uncle Sam’s Lend-Lease program. When the kulesh is ready, it needs to be delivered to the troops. Glen is tasked with carrying heavy food containers through the natural obstacle course of a snowy forest while under ‘friendly fire’ from a machine gun. That kulesh had better be good!

For a close up look at an authentic WWII Russian field kitchen, check out Taste of Russia, Episode 2.

➡️ Subscribe to BabbleTop: 

Fast food restaurants have become essential in the daily lives of many people. But recently, more and more people are avoiding them because of the greasy and high-fat foods. With mainstream fast food restaurants adding vegetarian and vegan options to their menu, like the Beyond Burger a plant based meatless patty, they are looking at a changing landscape - not only in menu but in technological innovations. While no one is going to knock Mickey D’s off the throne just yet, here are the fast food restaurants and companies that are paving the way for the menus of the future.

If you enjoyed this list of the top 10 fast food restaurants of the future, then comment:   

TIMESTAMPS: 
 Salad and Go
 Cultured South
 Veggie Grill
 Freshii
 Impossible Foods
 Cafe X
 By Chloe
 Eatsa
 The Herbivorous Butcher
 Next Level Burger

SUMMARIES:
- Who says salads can’t be a part of a drive-thru menu? Well, thanks to Salad and Go’s innovativeness, you don’t have to consume a daily donut and coffee for breakfast (and fries, like some people do).
- Cultured South is not serving Beyond Burgers nor any other innovative plant-based meat. Instead, this casual restaurant is a kombucha taproom. Kombucha is what the ancient Chinese referred to as the “immortal health elixir.” 
- Just like The Beyond Burger’s healthy patties, Veggie Grill’s burgers are also plant based which primarily consists of pea protein. They also have “chicken” sandwiches on their menu which consists of soy, pea, and wheat protein. 
- Freshii is way ahead of its vegan food chain rivals. This fast food restaurant has been serving salads, wraps, and bowls for nearly 15 years. Started in Canada in 2005, it now prides itself in having more than 300 franchises worldwide.
- Due to The Beyond Burger’s success, the race for the best vegan burger has started. While not a restaurant, Impossible Foods joined the battle in the search for an innovative vegan food that could be loved by avid carnivores, too.
- For Cafe X, many questioned if a robot can really make a quality cup of coffee but indeed, many customers gave rave reviews. Starting to serve people in 2017, the Cafe X robot did not fail. 
- If you are a foodie and a social media buff rolled into one, then By Chloe is a must visit. It’s not just another vegan food place serving healthy food, but the whole setup itself is optimized for social media. You might call their food instafood instagood with all the bright colors, attractive interior designs, and tempting menu.
- Eatsa is another food chain that is ahead of its time. Hungry customers can place their order on the iPad on display inside the shop. Although cashiers were replaced by tablet screens, human workers still prepare and cook these orders in the back.
- The Herbivorous Butcher is a vegan butcher shop owned by siblings Kale and Aubry Walch. Wait, a vegan butcher? Yes, you heard that right, a butcher shop but without the slaughter. It’s actually a vegan shop that started at home.
- True to its name, this burger joint brings the burgers to your table to the next level. It’s not because they boast that their burgers come from an ethical farm or because they’ll serve them just like an expensive restaurant does. It is because their burger is plant-based. Its ingredients are composed of pea protein, yeast extract, and coconut oil.

163,CyI5JBR,7 DAY WATER FAST - NO FOOD FOR A WEEK (Before & After),"DISCLAIMER: We are not doctors, nor experts on fasting. We do not recommend anyone do a medically unsupervised water fast. If we had not been in Northern Spain when Lou got injured, he would have gone to True North Health Center () in California to do his water fast with the support of their medical team. If you are under 18 years old, on medication, addicted to any substances, have currently or had a history of eating disorders, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have heart problems or any other diseases it is even more important that you seek the advice of a medical professional before attempting a water fast on your own. 

It might sound really crazy to you, but Lou did a 7 DAY WATER FAST! If you've never heard of a water fast, it is very simple: don't eat any food or drink anything other than pure filtered water for a specified amount of time, so for Lou that was one entire week without any food, no coffee, no tea, no lemon water, no juice, or vitamins - just plain filtered water and rest. 

You might be familiar with the trendy diet called Intermittent Fasting. Here people only eat in a certain window of time (16 hr fast/9 hr feed or 14 hr fast/10 hr feed) and while this has lots of touted health benefits, Lou was in need of relief fast from a horrible back injury and decided he'd do whatever he could to get results quickly as possible. One of the main benefits of fasting is the body's ability to reduce inflammation. Instead of spending lots of energy digesting food, the body can now work to rebuild the immune system and while there still aren't many long term trials of fasting's effects on humans, science is showing that fasting can be used to help treat a whole host of problems like heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, high blood pressure, and autoimmune diseases. Over 6 years ago Lou was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the joints, and over the course of the last few years has been able to get off medication and manage his symptoms with the help of a low-fat oil free plant based vegan diet. However, when he does stray from a health-promoting diet his RA symptoms do begin to resurface. So while we're not sure if his back injury had to do with his RA, either way, the autoimmune disease makes his healing process extremely slow. We live in a van, so being immobile was actually a very scary experience, and left Lou to embark on this water fasting journey.  The before and after is astounding as his pain levels went from an 8 out of 10 to... well you have to watch for that! 

Before we get to the video, I just wanted to say that a lot of people come to water fasting searching for a quick fix for weight loss and I really recommend that you reconsider. Water fasting is a wonderful tool to manage health conditions with the help of doctor supervision, but when it comes to weight loss it might not be your most effective tool because if post fast you continue all the same habits you will be left in the same position. If you are searching for weight loss please research a low-fat plant-based diet, but mainly I want you to really think about where the desire to lose weight is coming from. Our society tells us constantly that we are not good enough and instead of buying into this lie, this might be the time you instead embrace yourself as you are. Focus on self-love, body-acceptance, and finding self-worth outside of ascetics. Diet culture is toxic, and while I know it's complicated for me to write about it as we are huge advocates for a low-fat vegan diet as its been an incredible tool to manage Lou's autoimmune disease, in the end, I want people to know that they are worthy as is. No crazy lifestyle changes will change your relationship to yourself unless you do the mental work. 

Thanks for being here with us and while I know water fasting might make a lot of people uncomfortable it was an incredible experience for Lou and I hope you can see how much it helped him.

164,NGxcr_Z8D,5 Must-Try Japanese Food Experiences in Tokyo,"Japanese Food is awesome, and the overall dining experience is just as fun. If you are looking for places to eat in Tokyo, here are five great Japanese food experiences that I love while living in Tokyo. 

1. Japanese Grill (Robata) - You sit around a few men who cook all of the meat and vegetables right in front of you on a grill. You just point to what you want and they grab it with their giant wooden spatulas. 

2. Ramen - My favorite Japanese food, and perhaps the most well recognized Japanese dish apart from sushi. There are hundreds of places to choose from in Tokyo, each with their own rendition of the classic. One spot where you can get a large variety of options is on ""Ramen Street"" in the lower level of Tokyo Station. 

3. Yakitori - Meat and veggies on sticks, cooked over a similar grill as the Robata, Yakitori is a favorite among Tokyo residents because it's fast and goes great with beer. The most famous area for Yakitori in Tokyo is down ""Memory Lane"" or ""Piss Alley"" just outside the Shinjuku Train Station. 

4. Chanko Nabe - The ultimate in gluttony for a normal civilian, but a necessary bulking strategy for up-and-coming sumo wresters in the Ryogoku neighborhood of Tokyo. There are many different versions of this massive stew, and they are all aggressive and delicious. 

5. Conveyor Belt Sushi - As I mention in the video, there are a million different ways sushi is served in Tokyo. One of the most fun methods is by way of the conveyor belt sushi. 

*Bonus* - Convenient stores such as FamilyMart, Lawson's, and 7 Eleven are a major part of Japanese Food culture in Tokyo. People are busy and need a quick meal, so I wanted to take you around real quick and show you what's inside!

Tracing the making of a bowl of wonton noodle soup, a 101 East investigation exposes the toxic stew this iconic dish has become.

From tainted additives in noodles, to growth hormones in pork, to industrial filler posing as meat, presenter Steve Chao finds that anything is possible for producers looking to cut corners and make a fast buck.

181,f9P5Phj0TFY,A taste of conflict: The politics of food in Jerusalem - Street Food,"The ancient city of Jerusalem is sacred to three different faiths: for Jews it is the site of their first holy temple; for Christians it is the scene of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection; and for Muslims it is the location of the Prophet Muhammad's ascent to heaven.

A site of vast historical and religious significance, this beautiful city is also a tragic one - fought over for centuries and coveted by millions who have never set foot in it. It is at the heart of the ongoing and seemingly irresolvable Israeli-Palestinian conflict and everything there is overshadowed by politics.

Jerusalem's old city enthralls with its bustling markets and vibrant street life, but inside its walls, tensions are never far from the surface. History is a dimension of the present and there is little unity to be found in a city which Palestinians regard as their occupied capital.

In the struggle for the soul of a city, even food - a marker of identity, an expression of history, culture, and values - plays a part, and the roots of certain foods are fiercely debated.

For Palestinians, denied a state and with a national identity which is constantly undermined, food plays an even greater role in defining who they are.

Almost half of Israeli Jews come from Middle Eastern backgrounds where their parents and grandparents lived alongside Arabs in countries such as Iraq, Yemen and Morocco. Many dishes are a reminder of the shared history and culture of Arabs and Jews - something easily forgotten in today's divided politics. 

In a city where Israelis and Palestinians attach great meaning and symbolism to food - whether religious, political or both - we visit a unique place, Eucalyptus, which is jointly owned by Palestinians and Israelis.

There, we sample dishes made by an Israeli Jew, a Palestinian Muslim, an Armenian, and a Palestinian Christian who, as 'Chefs for Peace', cook together to bridge religious and political divides. Convinced that ignorance about the other is at the heart of the conflict, the chefs try to educate people about others' history, traditions, and culture through the medium of food. 

This film was first broadcast on Al Jazeera English in July 2008.

182,5RwIWGkMxrE,How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters–led by Alice Waters–voiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

183,LwBUfB7hU6A,The race to save endangered foods,"Wild animals aren’t the only ones facing extinction.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

We’re letting foods we’ve eaten for thousands of years disappear from farmers’ fields, and from our plates. Saving them isn’t just a matter of cultural preservation. In the next 30 years, we’re going to need to learn how to feed more people on a hotter planet, and the more genetic varieties we lose, the harder it’ll be to adapt. 

To learn more about the foods facing extinction in the US and around the world, check out the Ark of Taste, a project of Slow Food USA.

Journalist Mark Shapiro’s book, Seeds of Resistance, goes into much more detail about the risk that genetic homogeneity poses to our food supply. He also profiles some of the efforts, many led by indigenous communities, to preserve older seed varieties. 

For more on seed relabeling, check out the Farmers Business Network’s 2018 Seed Relabeling Report.

The chart on declining global yields for corn, wheat, and rice comes from an article in the academic journal Disasters and Climate Change Economics from agricultural economists Mekbib G. Haile, Tesfamicheal Wossen, Kindie Tesfaye, and Joachim von Braun. Their prediction model takes into account both climate change and price volatility, which is why their estimates are higher than those of some other researchers. 

Special thanks to Marie Haga of Global Crop Diversity Trust, and Marleni Ramírez of Bioversity International for sharing their knowledge with me.

203,PVEeScXdSVU,Philippines STRANGEST food! ETAG in Sagada | Travel Philippines Vlog,"I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. 
As a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!

Just a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. 

I'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. 

I'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party. Stay tuned!

Inspired by the Best ever food review show and their various interesting Filipino travel vlogs about foods like Catching and eating Wild Tamilok in Palawan.... Is this Philippines Strangest or Scariest Food? 

Where are my Filipino and Filipina subscribers at!? Would you try this?

In this video, I show you where to find the very best Amsterdam food! I take you on a walking tour of the Albert Cuyp Market in Amsterdam where I taste test many different Dutch street food items. 

Named after a 17th century painter, Albert Cuyp, the market has since become an institution for this bustling European city. Located on the Albert Cuypstraat (that is the name of the street) between Ferdinand Bolstraat and Van Woustraat...the market's central location makes it the perfect place to stroll through on the way to a nearby museum or on the way to a picnic. 

Visiting the Albert Cuyp Market is a definite must-see when you're in Amsterdam! Another plus is that this market is great for travelers on a budget because there are a lot of Amsterdam food options (traditional Dutch dishes) that can be had for under $3 Euro. 

A list of Amsterdam street food I ate at the Albert Cuyp Market:

I began with my favorite item, the stroopwafel. When I think of Amsterdam food, stroopwafel is the first thing that comes to mind. Essentially it is a waffle, but it's nothing like an American waffle. This unique pastry is made with flour, butter and sugar, but the real excitement is in the middle of the waffle. The waffle is cut in the middle (which is a miracle because it is so thin!) and then copious amounts of brown sugar syrup are knifed onto it, and then it is sealed once again. Stroopwafel is best eaten warm! The predominant flavor is cinnamon and the waffle itself is both crisp on the outside but soft inside. It's absolutely delightful and it tasted a lot different than I was expecting. 

Next, I tried some raw herring called Nieuwe Herring which translates into “New Herring.”This means that the fish has either been caught that actual day or the day prior. Nieuwe Herring is another must try dish when it comes taste testing Amsterdam food! Since it was herring season in the summertime (until around Sept), I decided to try out some fresh herring the Dutch way (with pickles and raw onions). It was absolutely incredible! I am now a herring addict.

After this I drank some fresh pressed raspberry juice mixed with blackberries and orange juice. You can find juice stands all along the market. A normal glass of juice costs around 1 EUR. 

Then after this, I moved onto a spicy chicken sandwich at Benny's Chicken. This food stand claims to have the best chicken in all of Amsterdam. After tasting their spicy chicken sandwich covered in cheese, I have to admit that is was really good! The pieces of chicken are succulent and juicy. Definitely a delicious sandwich if you're craving something cheesy!

After this I bought some dates at Ron's Notenbar. Notenbars (which literally translates into “nut bar”) are a very common sight in Amsterdam. There are a couple notenbars at the Albert Cuyp Market and they all offer different items which is nice. Duchies love their fresh fruits and nuts, especially as a mid-day snack! I was impressed by their selection of dates, but I highly recommend getting a couple bags of different dried fruits and nuts.  

Next, I purchased some aged gouda cheese at a cheese shop called Daalder Kaas. They sell traditionally ripened cheese and an array of aged gouda cheeses. I selected an aged gouda cheese which I thought was nice and creamy. It had a sharp flavor, but wasn't overwhelming. 

I thought all of the Amsterdam food I tasted at the market was wonderful!  Make sure to come earlier than 5pm as some vendors tend to pack up around 3pm (or when they sell out of the goods). It's best to arrive in the early afternoon.

220,5RwIWGkMxrE,How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters–led by Alice Waters–voiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

#10 Prime Meat
The prime cut meats that smaller restaurants and corporations sell are one of the biggest complaints that high-end chefs and physicians make. That’s because ‘prime cut’ suggests that it is a single cut of the best meat from the animal.
But this isn’t the case in many restaurants. Actually, what if I told you they chop up all the leftover meat and glue it back together? Does the word transglutaminase ring a bell? This is the name for the meat glue they use to glue the low quality meat back together to make you think you’re getting a full piece. This is more than a lie, this is disgusting. 
Besides the fact that it is using the worst tiny cuts of meat, it’s made from ammonia. The stuff used in fertilizers and oven cleaners. They try to fight back by claiming it kills E Coli, which should not be something we should be worried about being on meat anyway. Justifying making people unknowingly eat ammonia just so they can pass off scrap meat does not seem ethical in the least. Be very careful where you eat your steak! See, this is why being a vegetarian seems like a safer option! Or maybe seafood….
#9 Imitation Crab
Or maybe not seafood. For one, crustaceans feed off the worst possible debris on the bottom of the ocean. The only nastier creature is shrimp. This stuff they eat doesn’t magically disappear when they are caught and cooked either. There’s still…stuff in it that we eat…secondhand.
Nevertheless, it’s expensive to buy fresh crab and shrimp, but you can get crab cakes and other delicacies at the grocery store for a pretty good price. Why? It’s usually because it is fake, under the guise of imitation crab meat.
Imitation crab meat is made from the remains of other fish that are mushed together, and injected into a mold. They mince and mince random fish, whatever they can get their hands on, until it turns into the same texture as crab. It is then created into a paste that is frozen and then shaved into crab-like flakes. To make it taste like crab, they just add flavor and paint it to look like crab. 
So, next time you go for some cheap crab, remember that’s probably, beaten, frozen, shaved, and painted fish remains. I kind of like imitation crab but not really a fan of this process...it still tastes good so if you’re okay with this…then go ahead. 
#8 Parmesan Cheese
Parmesan cheese is delicious! Especially, real authentic parmesan cheese. But did you know that companies will usually lie about what’s in “parmesan”?
The FDA regulations make it legal to sell fake Parmesan cheese. This is some scary stuff. There are two huge deal breakers with parmesan. One is grated parmesan in the shaker. Most of the time, cellulose and mold inhibitor chemicals are added so it won’t clump. Cellulose, not cellulite, that’s just an after effect. Cellulose comes from ground up wood pulp and is considered “harmless and organic matter”. 
They usually add 2-4% cellulose, but the FDA doesn’t restrict it. In fact, some has been proven to carry 20%! That’s a lot of cellulose on your pasta! 
The saddest part is, this is just allowed in the United States. Parmesan cheese legally means the kind of cheese that comes from Parma, Italy. But in the US, you can call it parmesan when it’s just dehydrated, grated mozzarella.
This is like the Kobe beef of cheeses. Most of the time, when you get parmesan, it’s not parmesan. It’s cellulose and a mixture of cheap cheeses.
#7 Egg Substitute
This one is a little different. No one knows what it is, but many believe that it’s a great substitute for people with egg allergies. But really, it’s still just eggs. 
They take mostly egg whites, fresh, frozen, or powdered, and add other ingredients. But not much. They actually just contain 99% egg whites! There’s not actually much substituting going on. It might be easier for people who don’t want to go to the trouble dealing with egg shells and yolks slipping everywhere, etc. 
In reality, it is called egg substitute because of that 1% that’s just artificial coloring,  salt, onion powder, and who knows what else. Why? Why would they just flavor egg whites? “Egg substitute” is kind of misleading and should be for people with egg allergies who need a substitute. It shouldn’t just be eggs. 
Maybe it’s substituting something else? Is it the bottle substituting for the shell? Bottom line is…this isn’t egg substitute, it’s just expensive eggs.",Food

225,DzuOaJ9f8qI,10 Foods You Should Never Eat,"We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it’s not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. 
Even if you see the juice labels “not from concentrate” or “100% pure”, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.
In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.
Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. 
When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it’s pink, purple, or red, it’s most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. 
Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.

SUMMARY
-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.
-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.
-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. 
-Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils’ trans-fat content.
-Manufacturers load “low-fat” yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.
-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.
-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.
-Microwave popcorn’s almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.
-If candy doesn’t contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.
-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.

Meat, milk, cereal, and fruit are products Americans consume on a regular basis. But did you know that some of these products are completely banned in other countries? They contain substances and chemicals that might be approved by the FDA, but are illegal by any other food administration. Let’s explore 10 foods banned in other countries!


Let’s start with artificial dyes. You probably know that M&Ms and other sweets contain artificial dyes that contribute to the product’s color and make it more appealing. But those dyes have been banned in Europe and many other countries around the world and replaced with natural dyes as they contain several harmful substances!

Wild salmon is considered as one of the healthiest foods with plenty of nutritional benefits. But did you know that many countries banned farm-raised salmon? Wait until you hear just how harmful salmon is for the environment and why it’s been banned in Australia as well as New Zealand!

We often hear about zero-calorie chips which are considered healthy. It’s due to a fat substitute called Olestra. But this substitute seems to have negative effects on our health! While it removes fat from products, it actually stops the body from receiving some of the most essential vitamins and nutrients, which is why it was banned in Canada and Europe.

Do you consume meat, Rice Krispies, sports drinks, calorie-free snacks, fruit, or GMO food? All of those have been banned from countries around the world because they include harmful substances that have negative effects on your health!

230,1r0ocJbsY-g,Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food,"Snacking through the Big Apple: Food carts in NYC - Street Food

Exploring the cultural diversity exemplified throughout the vibrant street food scene in New York City.
Known as the Big Apple, New York City is home to about nine million people [≈ population of Honduras, nation] and hosts an additional 40 million visitors every year, which makes for a lot of stomachs to feed. 

Quick snacks, above all the hot dog, are as synonymous with New York as yellow cabs and skyscrapers and reflect the city's eclectic ethnic mix.

Yet few people realise that many of the city's thousands of street vendors - including Brooklyn's famed 'Falafel King' - face a daily struggle that belies the city's wealthy and glamourous image.

As the first signs of Manhattan's morning hustle and bustle surface, the city's street vendors have already been at work for many hours. Storage garages are busy with the sound of these business owners cleaning and gleaming, stocking and getting things in order for their long days ahead.

Although there are many vendors native to NYC, there is a significant number of immigrant owners - many of whom have run their businesses for decades.

Their food carts symbolise a lot more than a quick and convenient snack for the hundreds of thousands that pound the pavements of the city. They are a chance to live life on their own terms, often after escaping political turmoil or significant economic instability in their homelands. 

But the challenge is far from ideal. Obstacles to a successful business range from finding the perfect selling spot - in spite of an unspoken brotherhood between the vendors that can and has led to rivalries - and adhering to legislation surrounding health and safety, to liquidity and endless working hours. 

On the other side of the river, street vendors in Brooklyn and Queens face an even tougher uphill battle. Catering to a rougher demographic, and often without the means - both financial and otherwise - food cart owners, many of whom are new to the US, tend to find themselves operating illegally and, at times, even dangerously. 

Follow this episode of Street Food to get a glimpse into the good, the bad and the delicious of New York's vendors.

235,go_QOzc79U,Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver,"http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.

Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.

Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.

Join Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution:

238,Qf5AkskQr1,18 Harmful Foods We Keep Giving to Children,"How to Keep Your Child Healthy. Proper nutrition is super important for your children’s health and well-being. If you wish them well and don’t want them to settle for unhealthy food choices that they are likely to repeat as they become older, pay attention to this video. It turns out some common foods we consider healthy are actually really bad for your kids. Here’s a list the foods that are harmful to children as well as wholesome alternatives. Even milk, juice, yogurt and cereal can be dangerous. 
Junk food is not surprisingly loaded with salt, sugar, and saturated fat. When consumed regularly, this deadly trio could cause obesity, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular diseases.

SUMMARY
-A glass of juice contains 5–6 teaspoons of sugar. The dissolved sugar immediately gets absorbed into the bloodstream, which is bad for the metabolism of carbohydrates.
-Yogurts with fruit contain a lot of sugar, fat, and calories, which all lead to children becoming overweight. It also increases their risk of getting diabetes.
-Flakes, muesli, and other similar cereals contain is a lot of sugar. All the healthy elements of corn, wheat, and oats are removed during production — only the carbohydrates are left.
-Honey can cause an allergic reaction, and sometimes honey contains bacteria, which can lead to a serious infectious disease called botulism.
-Grapes are large and slippery, and a child could choke on them. Grapes are also very difficult for a child’s digestive tract to process.
-No matter how harmless animal-shaped vitamins look, they should only be prescribed by doctors.
-Drinking fatty milkshakes regularly can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases.
-French fries, burgers, and pizza are loaded with salt, sugar, and saturated fat. When consumed regularly, this deadly trio could cause obesity, high cholesterol, and cardiovascular diseases.
-Caffeine, which is an ingredient in coffee, could affect calcium absorption, and this might weaken their bones.
-Soda contains calories, artificial sweeteners, and caffeine, all of which erode tooth enamel and cause mood swings.
-Processed meats like hot dogs, bacon, and bologna are rich in sodium and saturated fat. However, when consumed daily and in large amounts, they may increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and spikes in blood pressure.
-Chicken nuggets must go because they’re packed with preservatives, calories, salt, and a bit of sugar. 
-Potato chips contain loads of sodium and fat. Chips should never land in your grocery basket, and they should stay out of your child’s life as well.
-Ketchup is made from sugar, corn syrup, food coloring, and extra fat.
-Mac and cheese contains sodium, food preservatives, and noodles stripped of fiber. This same goes for canned spaghetti and ramen in plastic packages. 
-Canned tuna contains high levels of mercury, which is dangerous for their health.
-Cake, cookies, doughnuts, candies, and fruit snacks can cause tooth decay and cavities.
-According to the FDA, unpasteurized milk carries dangerous bacteria such as salmonella, E. coli, and listeria.

239,TJW9ic8,Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica,"""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. 


As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.

Cigarettes now only kill about a half million Americans every year, whereas our diet appears to kill hundreds of thousands more. The good news is that means we have tremendous power over our health destiny and longevity.

You will learn how to make square oranges to amaze your family, how to cut cheese using a plastic card if you don’t have a knife, the quickest way to squeeze lemons. If you have some old books you don’t want to throw away, glue covers together to make DIY knife holder. This cool project will add personality to your kitchen.  Glue kitchen hooks to the wooden hanger to store your collection of mugs. Check out the brilliant way to cut a cake! Moreover, we prepared super-delicious dishes you can prepare for a special event or amaze your friends! You going to love cheesy camembert recipes.
We love recipes with cheese as you can cook super delicious appetizers with minimum effort. Let’s start from baked brie with potatoes that could be the main dish also. Take 4-5 rounds of brie, cut the tops from brie and wrap in the dough and place the brie “tower” in the center of the baking tray. Put jacket potatoes around, spray potatoes with olive oil and add any spicy you like and bake for 60 minutes. Yummy! Another cool idea is to cool camembert with vegetables. Baked camembert with vegetables topping recipe: cut the camembert in half and place one half in the middle of pastry circle, add vegetable topping and potato slices. Cut the pastry in 8 parts, it will look like a flower. Use a glass to cut a circular line at the end of each petal. Fold petals one by one and brush with egg wash. Bake.
Don’t forget to share these kitchen ideas with your friends!

254,03vWwqYPf60,Organic food - hype or hope? | DW Documentary,"There is growing demand in the western world for organic food. But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?

Is organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk ""organic"" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare.

What do foreigners in the Netherlands think about Dutch gastronomy?

We asked people who are learning Dutch which typical Dutch dishes they know, and what they think about the Dutch cuisine (Nederlandse keuken).

What about the eating habits? How does a Dutch meal at dinner look like? Is it always potatoes + meat + a vegetable...? How about lunch... preparing sandwiches at home to take them with you to school or work?

271,4rrqc3Skwr8,22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY,"DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTY
We love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. 
Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  
Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!
Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole. Make incisions on bread and fill with the sauce (mix rosemary, garlic, and olive oil). Bake for 25 minutes. Yummy!

277,lwgXXVXM3I,"Fast food, Fat profits: Obesity in America | Fault Lines","Obesity in America has reached a crisis point. Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. 

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

People featured in this film: Marion Nestle, Marlene Schwartz, John Bode, Nelson Eusebio, J. Justin Wilson, Dr. Olajide Williams, Lauren Von Der Pool, Julie Paradis, Cathal Armstrong, Ed Bruske,

He has cycled across the United States, twice, on a bamboo bicycle, went 1,000 days without showering, and has dove into thousands of dumpsters across America, all to inspire positive social and environmental change. When not out adventuring he lives off the grid in a fifty-square-foot tiny home in San Diego. His extreme adventures and activism campaigns may appear unattainable at first glance but within them are an abundance of simple lessons and tips that can be adapted into any life to live with more happiness, health, and freedom.

Just to be clear, this video is not sponsored or endorsed by any of the restaurants depicted, or any other company. This was in fact a hidden camera exposé, and no foods were tampered with in any way.  They were all served to me exactly as they appear in the video. 

And in case you're wondering what I did with all of this food, my cameraman ate some of it and I gave the rest to the workers who were painting my next door neighbor's house. 

The video glasses I'm wearing are Pivotheads.

299,fwgVVTc40Q,10 Foods to Avoid to Get the Flat Belly You've Dreamed Of,"We all want to have a flat stomach, but even with intensive workouts and dieting belly fat remains the most difficult kind to get rid of. The secret that will help you drop some pounds is avoiding certain foods.  
You most likely know it already, but it won’t hurt going over it again: avoid junk food, fried foods, and ice cream. The more you get, the more you want to satisfy your ever-growing craving. If you’re seriously set on getting rid of belly fat, you really do have to kick the habit of drinking pop and store-bought juices. Even diet soda slows down your metabolism and makes your body store more fat. Speaking of drinks, you’ll also have to say no to alcohol. Some alcoholic beverages are loaded with calories, but it’s not just about the caloric content in certain drinks. Alcohol consumption itself increases your appetite and confuses the part of your brain that’s responsible for that full feeling in your stomach.
Along with sugar, salt should also be limited to small amounts, especially if you suffer from high blood pressure. Remember that one tablespoon of mayonnaise has about 100 calories.
Another food to avoid is chewing gum. When you chew gum, your brain and stomach get signals that prepare them for an incoming meal. This means that gum triggers the overproduction of stomach acid, which ends up making you feel hungry.

SUMMARY
-Alcohol consumption itself makes you feel hungry, so no matter how full you are, when you go for a bottle of beer, you usually grab a snack too.
-If you’re seriously set on getting rid of belly fat, you really do have to kick the habit of drinking pop and store-bought juices. 
-Gum triggers the overproduction of stomach acid, which ends up making you feel hungry, especially for sugary stuff. 
-Not only are high-sodium foods harmful to your health, they also make your body retain fluids, resulting in a puffy belly.
-Junk food is a scary mix of fat, sugar, and chemical additives that give it a great taste negatively affect the good bacteria in your gut, and that leads to obesity.
-If you’re a big fan of mayonnaise, then you should know that this condiment contains at least 80% fat.
-Foods fried in oil work like a sponge that absorbs saturated fats that trick your brain and so you just keep shoving food in your mouth without even noticing it.
-The more ice cream you get, the more you want to satisfy your ever-growing craving.
-Dairy, apples, lentils, beans, and artichokes all cause bloating which gives bulging bellies to even the skinniest people. 
-Artificial sweeteners in “diet” foods might have no calories in them, but they will make you want to eat more, which only leads to gaining excess weight.

If you're seriously trying to lose belly fat then you already know that diet is one of the most important pieces of the puzzle. With a proper diet plan where you're eating the right foods in the right amounts you'll strip off layer after layer of body fat and say goodbye to that belly forever. However, if you're eating the wrong things you'll only be setting yourself back further and further. With an improper diet plan you'll have to get used to loosening your belt notch after notch because your belly fat will be there to stay. So to ensure that you aren't making any mistakes with the food you're selecting I want to go over the 20 best foods that you should be eating regularly to lose that belly fat for good. The first food I want to start with is the avocado. Unlike other fruits that are loaded with carbs, Avocados are full of healthy monounsaturated fats specifically oleic acid. They are also full of fiber which will help you feel full for longer. Another great thing about avocados that was discovered during a study from The Ohio State University at Columbus is that avocados help you absorb more cartenoids from fruits and vegetables, up to 15x more to be exact. So not only will avocados help you burn fat, but you'll also be strengthening your immune system and absorbing more cancer fighting cartenoids than ever. Next we have eggs. Eggs are great to incorporate into your diet plan because they’re high in protein, high in healthy fats and they can help you feel full for a very low amount of total calories. Eggs are also one of the most bioavailable sources of protein out there. Meaning that your body can very efficiently digest, absorb, and assimilate the protein found in eggs. Having a solid protein source like eggs in your diet will help you prevent muscle loss while you eat less calories to create enough of a deficit to burn fat. Lets move on to one of the best fruits you can eat while trying to lose belly fat...berries. Compared to most other fruits berries are very low in carbohydrates, while being full in vitamins and antioxidants. These antioxidants can help improve blood flow delivering more oxygen to your muscles and your cells in general. Ultimately this can hep improve your workouts while assisting with the fat loss process. The best low carb berries to eat are blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. Blueberries are going to be a bit higher in carbs, so to keep calories low stick with the other 3. The next food isn't really a food, but instead its a drink that's been proven very effective at helping you fight that belly fat...apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to help people lose weight and waist circumference. These aren't they typical animal studies that you constantly see that don't necessarily guarantee the same results for people. Instead these are human studies. One of these studies was 12 weeks long and it demonstrated that obese individuals could lose anywhere from 2.6 to 3.7 pounds just by consuming 1 to 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar per day. It has also been shown to improve blood sugar spikes after meals, and it can help increase fullness after a meal. In fact one study showed that taking apple cider vinegar with a high carb meal could result in people eating 200 to 275 less calories for the day. Keep in mind, you want to make sure that you dilute only one to two tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar in water. Don't drink it straight up. Next I have another high protein food for you and that's tuna. Tuna is a very lean fish that's pretty much entirely made up of protein. This makes tuna a great option to increase protein intake without increasing calorie intake too much. The important thing is if you're buying canned tuna you want to make sure you get the tuna in water not oil. If you get it in oil then all the extra calories that you save from this low fat fish will be canceled out. Fish in general is a great option for when you're trying to burn fat

""Let thy Food be thy Medicine and thy Medicine be thy Food."" -- Hippocrates

That's the message from the founding father of modern medicine echoed in the controversial new documentary film 'Food Matters' from first-
time Producer-Directors James Colqhuoun and Laurentine ten Bosch.

""With nutritionally-depleted foods, chemical additives and ourtendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with
our malnourished bodies, it's no wonder that modern society is getting sicker. 'Food Matters' sets about uncovering the trillion dollar
worldwide ""Sickness Industry"" and giving people some scientifically verifiable solutions for curing disease naturally."" - James

And in what promises to be the most contentious idea put forward, the filmmakers have interviewed several world leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer.

'Food Matters' is to be launched globally via the internet using full screen video technology.

The film's official website can be found at ",Food
317,P2BVyHOdFU,You Can't Reheat Some Foods Under Any Circumstances,"Is it safe to microwave your food? Let's imagine you went out to dinner last night. Chances are you brought home the leftovers and they’re sitting in your fridge right now. But before you break out the styrofoam carton, pop it in the microwave, and chow down, you should know that there are some foods that actually turn poisonous when reheated! 

No matter how tasty and healthy your freshly prepared meal is, it can lose its health benefits and even cause food poisoning if you reheat it in a microwave. Bright Side introduces to you a list of foods that you should eat as soon as they’re cooked.

SUMMARY:
- Whether they’re in a soup or stir-fry, reheating mushrooms in the microwave or on the stove is a big no-no. The change in composition can cause you to have an upset stomach, and they also lose their health benefits.
- Similarly to mushrooms, eggs are packed with protein that changes once it’s reheated. This can wreak havoc on your digestive system. In fact, eggs can become toxic when exposed to a microwave’s high temperatures.
- Even if the rice is cooked, boiling water won’t kill the bacteria. After the rice cools off to room temperature, its bacteria spores can multiply, and reheating it just keeps the bacteria alive. The longer it sat at room temperature, the more likely it is to contain harmful bacteria.
- When it’s time to reheat the breast milk, you should never heat it in a microwave because the uneven distribution of heat can create hot spots in the milk, which can seriously burn the poor baby who drinks it.
- Just like mushrooms, reheating chicken can change the food’s protein compounds and make you very sick. Unlike other meat (like beef), chicken contains a high amount of protein, which makes reheating it in the microwave a bad idea.
-  If you place cooked potatoes directly into the fridge after cooking them, it’s probably safe to reheat them. However, if they sit out at room temperature for a while after they’re prepared, they’re more likely to develop a rare bacteria known as botulism. 
- While nitrites are dangerous for adults, they’re incredibly dangerous for infants from 0 to 6 months. If they do ingest food with nitrites, they are more likely to develop “blue baby syndrome,” which can be fatal.
- Before you stick a leftover sandwich in the microwave, don’t forget to remove any toothpicks the restaurant may have stuck in there! Along with items with sharp tips, metal is a big no-no when it comes to microwave cooking.

In today's video we highlight a list of vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices which have little to no carbs and no sugar. These are practical when on a no sugar diet, or low carb diet such as the ketogenic or carnivore diet. High amounts of sugar taken regularly will cause damage to the body and chronic inflammation over time. Reducing these and eating healthier sources of vitamins and minerals will help your body to get back into sync and heal itself naturally.

Lyrics:

Intro (spoken)

Yo man...
Yo I know you see me here dude!!
I've been waiting here like 10 minutes, man!
No, no no... this is MY parking space man.
What you need to do is put your little hybrid in reverse, 
And go out the way you came in.
WHAT?!?!
Yo its about to get REAL in the Whole Foods parking lot man...

Chorus  (with feeling)

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
I got my STEEL and you know it gets sparked a lot
Im on my grind homie... It's on my mind homie!
These fools with clip boards are lookin' at me like they know me!

It's getting' REAL in the Whole Foods Parking Lot
You know the DEAL with the little shopping carts they got...
Check out what I say, it happens every day...
It's how we LIVE on the west side of LA!!

Verse 1

... Im ridin' slow in my Prius...
all leather, tinted windows... you cant see us!!
Everybody's trying to park, you can feel the tension
I'm in electric mode... can't even hear the engine (Shhhhhhh)

Just then I saw a spot open up, 
My timings perfect... Im creepin' up...
But then this other dude tried to steal it going the wrong way
Yo man, I've had a LONG DAY!

Chorus 
(same as before)

Verse 2

Now I'm on this inside, looking at my list
Organic chicken, Kale Salad and a Lemon Twist.
Some girl in yoga pants is lookin at me funny
I'm just trying to find a decent Pinot Noir for under twenty!

Then I take it to the cheese counter, Humboldt Fog?
We just ran out sir!  Really Dog?
Take it easy man, I try to calm myself...
I've been on edge ever since they took Kombucha off the shelf...

Chorus

(same as before)

Verse 3

This Busters on his iPhone talking to his friends, 
Picking up some cayenne pepper for his master cleanse.
You're the most annoying dude I've ever SEEN brah... 
Could you PLEASE move?  You're RIGHT in front of the Quinoa.

Damn, I'm about to check out.
Pay my 80 bucks for 6 things and get the heck out.
The express lane is moving hella slow...
Man, these fools don't know... that shit is getting REAL....

Chorus
(same as before)

Do you know WHAT you are eating? You may think you are eating 100% pure food, but the answers is alarmingly different. Take the fast food restaurant Subway for example. Their chicken only contained 50% real chicken. The rest was soy fillers. But soy fillers are not too bad compared to fake eggs. In 2012, scammers in China produced eggs cheaper than the supermarket by creating a mold where they combined resin, starch, coagulant, and pigments. Talk about fake food! But wait there’s more! Also in China, a gang of traders bought a whole bunch of rat, fox, and minx flesh and sold it as lamb! Check out the rest of these 25 insane food scandals that actually happened.

338,RwZY1jaw2EM,Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes,"Dear Friend,

What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. 

About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.

At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.

'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.

Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!

Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.

James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten Bosch

Producer / Directors 'Food Matters'

PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  

""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'

""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com


 ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""
- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series


 ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen. I encourage you to order a copy of Food Matters today and watch it with your friends and family.""

Camille Richman is a Research Specialist in the MIT Media Lab’s Open Agriculture Initiative, which develops open source controlled environment agriculture technology platforms that promote food transparency, networked experimentation, hands-on education, and local food production.

Camille is a mechanical engineer in Open Agriculture’s anti-disciplinary team of architects, computer scientists, electrical engineers, and farmers.

Her work is currently focused on the development of the Food Computer, a desktop controlled environment farm that can be used to create and share climate recipes, modifications, and upgrades.

348,W2L_02p-xn,6 High Estrogen Foods MEN SHOULD AVOID!,"These are 6 High Estrogen Foods Men Should Avoid to build muscle, lose weight, and get lean. Some foods should be limited and others should be completely avoided. Instead of increasing estrogen most men want to learn how to increase testosterone naturally & fast. By learning how to decrease estrogen levels, weight loss becomes much easier.

The next food that you'll want to limit to keep your estrogen levels down is wheat and grain based products. These foods are extremely high in a type of xenoestrogen known as zearalenone or ZEA. ZEA is molecularly similar to estrogen and acts like estrogen in the body. One study examined the effect that ZEAs had on a drug called Letrozole, which is specifically designed to lower estrogen levels in the body. Bodybuilders will often take it get to really low levels of body fat. The researchers found that, even small amounts of ZEA negated the effects of Letrozole. That’s a powerful indicator of the estrogen boosting effect of all those ZEA’s that are found in wheat and grain products. As well as the ZEA problem, wheat also contains phytoestrogens. They’re found in the wheat germ which is the reproductive part of the wheat seed. These phytoestrogens will bind to estrogen receptor sites in your body’s cells. In a study that was designed to investigate the combined effect of wheat germ and a breast cancer treatment pharmaceutical it was noted that one of the side effects of wheat germ was that it increased estrogen receptor activity of MCF-7 cells. However, refined grain products remove the germ, making them slightly less of a problem when it comes to estrogen. Overall though, you should limit your consumption of wheat and grain based products. Our third estrogen food type to avoid is processed carbs and refined sugars. Hopefully, you’ve already cut back on these types of foods if you're trying to bring your body fat levels down. But there’s an extra reason to ditch these types of carbs. And it has to do with that powerful blood sugar regulating hormone, insulin. As well as causing you to store more body fat, insulin lowers your body’s levels of what is known as sex hormone binding globulin. The job of this globulin is to bind the two sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen, together. When it's doing its job properly, you will have limited amounts of free estrogen in your body. But, when it's stopped from doing its job, the opposite will be the case, your free estrogen levels will be much higher. It’s the insulin response that occurs when you eat refined sugar foods that causes the interference in the activity of sex hormone binding globulin. An interesting study that focused on women showed that drinking sugar laden sodas increased estrogen levels. The interesting thing was that increased estrogen levels did not occur with either diet sodas or fruit juices. Researchers believe this is due to the fact that diet sodas don’t contain refined sugar and fruit juice contains natural fruit sugars. Another estrogen related problem with sugar consumption is that, eating too much sugar leads to an increase in stored body fat. Fat cells excrete estrogen. So, the more fat cells that you have sitting around your body, the more estrogen you’ll have floating around as well. This is additional to the estrogen produced by the endocrine system. So, rather than reaching for a sweet sugar saturated treat, do your estrogen levels a favor and opt for foods that are high in proteins, fiber and healthy fats. Our fourth no go food for estrogen is beer. I know, this is a tough one. Now, I’m not saying you can’t drink it at all, but if you want to get really lean and maximize your muscle mass and strength, then you gotta’ cut back on the booze.  Here’s why. As you know beer contains hops. But what are hops? Well, they're actually the female part of the hop plant. They’re a preservative that has been added to beer for

Is it worth the waiting for,
If we live till eighty-four
All we ever get is gruel,
Every day we say our prayers
Will they change the bill of fair?
Still we get the same old gruel
There's not a crust not a crumb
Can we find can we beg can we borrow or cadge,
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,
When we all close our eyes and imagine,

Food glorious food
Hot sausage and mustard
While we're in the mood cold jelly and custard
Pease pudding and saveloys
What next is the question?
Rich gentlemen have it boys
IN-DI-GESTION

Food glorious food
What is there more handsome
Gulped swallowed or chewed
Still worth a kings ransom
What is it we dream about?
What brings on a sigh?
Piled peaches and cream about six feet high

353,QygPpMeXEV,Making Global Research Connections Through Food,"For many faculty members, summer is an especially important time for research. For some scholars in fields such as anthropology and linguistics, research is conducted living and working among people in different communities. Sometimes those communities are close to home, and other times far away from the University of Rochester, both geographically and culturally. 

Researchers such as Timothy Dye—a medical anthropologist and social epidemiologist at the Medical Center with an appointment in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology—and Nadine Grimm, an assistant professor of linguistics who specializes in African languages—have conducted field research in remote communities where a key component of their work is gaining the trust of the people there. 

There are many dimensions to gaining that trust, but among the most basic involves the sharing of food.
 
Dye recalls his first real-life lesson in the importance of eating local foods while working in remote communities. He was in the Kashmir region of the Himalayas about 30 years ago conducting surveys about diarrhea in the village children. After entering the first house, he turned on his tape recorder and began asking family members questions about their beliefs about the causes of the diarrhea and their treatments. But the interview was not going particularly well.

“A woman ladled some chai into a metal cup and handed it to me. Sanitation was a huge issue in the village, so naturally I wondered about the milk and water that were mixed into the tea,” says Dye. “But I remembered a basic rule about doing field research in anthropology, which requires us to accept any offering of food or drink, lest we offend someone and risk an entire research project.”

Dye drank—then gulped—the warm tea, which he found to be rich and creamy, as well as satisfying in the cold, high-altitude environment. At that point, everyone broke into a more natural conversation, leaving the research questions for another—and more successful—day.

""For some communities, eating certain foods means that you're a part of that nationality,"" says Dye. ""If you drink chang, a type of homemade beer in Tibet, it's said you're Tibetan.""
 
Depending on where he is working, Dye’s diet has included, in addition to chang, snakes, wildebeests, insects, giraffes, and bats. 

Nadine Grimm, who has studied languages in remote areas of South America and Africa, has enjoyed a similarly wide palette, which has included, for example, monkey and python.
 
""Eating local foods makes it easier to connect with indigenous communities,"" she says. ""Once they offer me food, I feel accepted, which makes it easier to do my research.""

It isn't just the culinary choices that are different in these remote communities; it's also the attitudes some cultures have toward food—and that includes the Bagyeli Pygmies, who are hunter/gatherers. 
 
""For the Bagyeli Pygmies, the entire day is preoccupied with how they'll get food,"" says Grimm. ""Sometimes they're unlucky and don't have enough food for themselves, let alone for a guest, which is why I stay in a nearby town and limit my meals with them.""
 
Because the availability of food varies greatly with the Bagyeli, dining with the community takes on added significance. ""They gradually offered me better food items, she says, “starting with steamed bread fruit and working their way up to wild meat."" 

“Eating local” in much of the United States is, of course, a trend more often than a necessity. It’s a trend that’s captured the interest of many college students, including at Rochester. 
 
This past semester, Dye and Grimm shared with undergraduate students some of their thoughts and experiences about eating locally—globally—over a cooking and eating demonstration incorporating a couple of their favorite foods from Tibet and from Swahili-speaking regions of Africa. 

With increasing numbers of students coming to the University of Rochester from outside the United States, it's not uncommon to break bread with people from a variety of cultures that diverge widely from typical American traditions. For the students who took part in this cooking demonstration, it's just one more chance to broaden their perspective, and their palette.

royalties can be collected.

We will depend on them

for every seed we grow

of every crop we grow.

It's more powerful than bombs.

It's more powerful than guns.

This is the best way to control the populations of the world.""

Bull-ish they pulpit -- so caffeine,

Kit Kat like a click-clack holes in your genes

Cuz everything at market ain't all what it seems.

Little Debbie bussing biscuits at sugar-high fiends.

Ain't nothing but a G thing --

GMO, MSG, genocide of street gangs.

Aspartame or street cane.

Monsanto is Rambo.

Round Up with ammo.

Who would have known you can die from a diet

Diabetes and the -itis from the dairy and the dose

of the high fructose

cuz your ribs too close

so you might start a riot.

Might be a FOOD FIGHTER!

They shootin'!

Made you look

at the labels on the food that you cook.

Just say no to cocoa box

cuz when you Google the ingredients, you might get got.

Is your milk on drugs? Cuz your brain on Fox.

Factory farming spawning the Meatrix plot,

Globally warming us all, enough cows and NOx

driving the climate, driving a hummer or not.

Drive-in like a drive-by.

E.coli served super sized with a side of super lies.

so tell me what's more gangsta than that?

Bullets or burgers both blaze burners to black.

Breakfast is a little like Texas,

Petro is everything that you're eating on

My pesto is backyard like choppin' chard.

My school lunch pack a punch.

What's Beef?

Beef is when you're 12 years old and obese

clogged arteries, can't see your own feet

until you're up in ICU, guaranteed to be an 'I see you""

From that processed food.

Suicide. It's a suicide.

Don't want no microwaves, no pesticides.

Fast food's a slow death in disguise.

It's the wild wild westernized world of deception and lies.

What's Beef?

Beef is when you starve in a famine.

Nothing won't grow and the land stays barren.

Pollution in the river, mercury in the salmon.

What sense do it make, being at war with the planet?

We're at war for the mind so impressionable.

Instead of vegetables,

we reach for Red Bulls.

Poor diets kill more brothers than pistols.

We're fighting for our lives like Michael Vic's pit bulls.

Dog eat dog, America eats the young,

We die from beef, but more from meat than the gun.

Bullets for breakfast and mass murder meals.

Our travel and food in sikkim was fun, had great time in Gangtok...If you have any experience of Gangtok in terms of sightseeing or food, do share that in comments below…

Travelling cost:  Refer to EP 1 description section on how below cost is calculated.

Min cost to reach Gangtok: Rs 500.
Hotel: Rs 1500 per day.
Food Rs 500 one meal
Total cost of Day 0: Rs 2500

Day1 : Cab for local sightseeing  for 8 hours Rs 2500.
You may want to take share cab for point to point travelling but then you can't travel to all tourist destinations. 

Example from MG marg you can take a share cab for trolley point by paying Rs 20.. but you can't go to Hanuman Tok on share cab as on that route no share cab.,

OLA and uber taxi service not available.

you : can take cab for travelling from one point to another , but that's expensive they charge anything from Rs 200 to Rs 400...

Day 1 : 
cab : 2500
food 1000
hotel: 1500
Total cost of Day 1: Rs 5000.
Above cost will apply for Day 0 and Day 1 will be 2500 plus 5000 equals to 7500.

I paid much higher cost because i had exclusive taxi all the time, i stayed in 3 category hotel which was expensive.


As always i love to read your comments and reply back on them… thanks for your time…",Food

Most people I meet think they’re pretty healthy, but when I probe a little deeper into their diets, I quickly find out they are eating a lot of “health” foods you should never eat. I can’t blame them. With all of the confusion surrounding labelling and advertising, buzzwords like “sugar-free,” “all-natural” and even “organic” can be really confusing. I want to clear the air.

In this episode of Ancient Medicine Today, I discuss the top 10 toxic foods you should remove from your diet and the top 10 healing foods to add to help restore and fuel your body.

SUMMARY:
- TV dinners first stepped onto the scene in the 1950s when Swanson was looking for a way to sell their Thanksgiving food leftovers. They came up with the idea of serving ready-made food frozen on a convenient tray.
- If you ever ate dinner at your grandma’s house as a kid, you probably tasted the stuff once or twice. Gelatin was first used in dishes back in medieval Europe and was partly made from the collagen in animal bones.
- Back in 1968, many kids could be seen sipping on a cold bottle of SunnyD as a part of a well-balanced breakfast — and it was anything but. SunnyD tasted super sweet because it was primarily made of corn syrup and contained less than 5% juice. 
- One Hi-C Wild Cherry juice box contained a whopping 27 g of sugar, which is more than the American Heart Association recommends grown women ingest in a day — and these were intended for kids! 
- Back in the late ’80s and ‘90s, Bubble Tape was a fan fave! But ever, since sugar-free gum became more popular and oral health, became more of a priority, this sugary sweet gum just wasn’t as desirable anymore.
- Ambrosia salad was usually found at family gatherings back when you or your parents were younger. This sweet salad actually came onto the scene back in the 1800s and usually featured special sweet treats that only appeared on special occasions. 
- Once people realized how bad trans fats were for them during the ‘90s, Crisco stopped being used as often.
- It wasn’t until the 1950s that cottage cheese became incredibly popular. It’s very mild in flavor and isn’t super high in fat, which was appealing to people from the ‘50s into the ‘70s.

They’ve operated an environment centre in their town for over 20 years, where the community comes together to learn and discuss, buy produce and sit by the warm fire over a cuppa. We’ve even heard of folk who’ve up and moved to Riverton because they’re so inspired by the Guytons!

387,KoUcEcz1dM,8 Foods that Are Actually Damaging Your Kidneys,"Have you ever noticed that final powerful spray of water at the carwash before your vehicle gets a rapid blow dry? The water jets pulverize any remaining remnants of dirt.

That’s one way to view how our kidneys work. Their job is to flush out toxins from the blood by way of urine. The National Institutes of Health reports that our kidneys filter an excess of 200 quarts of blood daily. That translates into 2 quarts of waste each day. They don’t get holidays or weekends off; they work day and night.

Thankfully, our kidneys can wash away impurities while retaining vital nutrients floating around in our blood. Keeping our internal filters healthy and functioning properly is invaluable for nourishment and detoxification of our bodies. 

So naturally, whatever we eat and drink has a dramatic impact on our kidneys’ health. A steady diet of unhealthy food and drinks can strain their performance, and put us at risk.

The good news is, it’s never too late to improve your diet and lifestyle, even if your kidneys are already impaired.
 
In today’s video we will see how our kidneys react to too much consumption of 8 different foods and beverages.

1. Red meat
We’ve all heard that protein is good for our health. But too much of anything can be harmful. For example, a diet that is high in red meat, which contains lots of animal protein, can damage our kidneys. The reason? Our kidneys need to metabolism this protein. 

When there’s a conveyor belt of rich protein headed toward the kidneys for cleansing, they  just can’t keep up with the pace. When kidneys can’t eliminate waste products, there will be a build-up of acidic residue in our body.
It’s always good to talk to your health care professional about the diet that’s right for you.

2.  Alcohol
Just like eating too much red meat can strain our kidneys, the same is true with too much alcohol; they will be unable to properly filter our blood. Also, too much alcohol can cause dehydration. This creates a domino effect: if our blood is dehydrated, our cells and organs will not be able to function properly.

3. Table Salt
While our bodies require sodium to maintain proper fluid balance – especially in our electrolytes - an excess amount will cause kidneys to retain water. Too much salt can also increase the amount of protein that is eliminated in urine.

4. Caffeine
Caffeine is a stimulant which millions of people depend upon every morning to help them become fully awake. But all of that caffeine in coffee, tea and sodas can jolt your kidneys into overdrive. The stimulant accelerates blood flow, which in turn increases blood pressure.

Caffeine has another effect – it can lead to dehydration, just as salt can. Too much dehydration can lead to kidney stones. Most health experts recommend you drink no more than 2 cups of coffee or 3 cups of tea daily. Soda and energy drinks are beverages you may want to eliminate completely. Another source of caffeine is cocoa, which should also be consumed moderately.

5. Artificial Sweeteners
Refined sugar has had a bad rap lately. That’s why companies began creating artificial sweeteners. It may sound better for our health, but they can still negatively impact kidney function. Try instead to steer away from artificial sweeteners and use stevia or honey to flavor your food and beverages.

6. Dairy Products
While dairy products are an excellent source of protein, they should be consumed in moderation, especially for anyone who has kidney disease. The reason?  Too many dairy products will increase calcium in urine which can lead to kidney stones. Also, as kidneys are overworked, they won’t be able to regulate protein waste and it will rise to an unhealthy level.

7. Carbonated Beverages
Sodas and energy drinks are usually the chief instigator for kidney problems; they are loaded with caffeine, sugar or artificial sweeteners. They may taste better than thirst-quenching water or lemon water but they aren’t providing any health benefits for your kidneys.  
 
8. Genetically Modified Foods (GMOs)
In recent years, crops have been the recipient of various forms of herbicides and pesticides. This includes everything from strawberries to rice.

401,MNqXakhb00,FEMA Accessible: USDA Food Safety After a Disaster,"FEMA video in partnership with US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Director of Food Safety Education, Chris Bernstein, about food safety after a disaster in American Sign Language (ASL).

Closed captioning is available in English, Chinese, German, Hindi, Italian, Khmer, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian, Tagalog, Thai, and Vietnamese. 

[Transcript:]

Hello, my name is Chris Bernstein, and I am the Director of Food Safety Education at the US Department of Agriculture. I'm here today to talk to you about food safety for returning home after a disaster. 

Coming back home after a disaster can be a very challenging experience. One of the most important things you and your family will have to do is sort through the food in your refrigerator, freezer, and pantry. 

You will need to throw away any food that has come into contact with flood water. This includes anything that is not in a waterproof container. Do not use food containers that have caps, snap lips, or pull tops that have come in contact with flood water. Any cardboard boxed food (such as macaroni and cheese, dry pasta, baby formula) contaminated with flood water is not safe to eat and should be tossed. 

Inspect all canned food to see if there is any swelling, leaking, holes, dents, or rust. Canned food can be saved and used to eat only if you do the following things:

- Remove the label off the can. 

- Brush or wipe away any dirt.

- Thoroughly wash the can with soap and water (hot water if available). Use water that is safe for drinking to rinse off the can. 

- Sanitize the can by immersion in either one of two ways:
o Put the can in a clean pot full of water and bring to a complete boil for 2 minutes; or
o Put the can in a clean pot full of clean drinking water and add one tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water used. Soak can in pot for 15 minutes.

- Let can air-dry for at least one hour before opening or storing can. 

- Write with a permanent marker on the can what is inside and the expiration date (if available). 

- Canned food items should be used as soon as possible after cleaning. 

You will also need to clean your pots, pans, dishes, and utensils by thoroughly washing them with soap and water (hot water if available). 

- Rinse and sanitize them by boiling them in clean water or immersing them in clean drinking water and add one tablespoon of unscented liquid chlorine bleach per gallon of water used. 

- Soak in water for 15 minutes.

Your drinking water may not be safe to drink when you come home after a disaster. You may need to use bottled water or boiled water. If you do not have bottled water, boil the water for one minute before letting it cool down. Store the water in clean containers with lids. 

If you are not able to boil water, you can disinfect it by using household bleach. This will help to kill most organisms in the water that might cause diseases. Add 8 drops (or 1/8 teaspoon) of regular, unscented liquid household bleach for each gallon of water to disinfect your water. Leave water alone for 30 minutes. Store the water in clean containers with lids. 

These safety tips should help you figure out what food you can save or have to throw away, how to clean your pots, pans, dishes, and how to make sure that your water is safe to drink. For more information on food safety, visit USDA’s website at www.fsis.usda.gov.

Eating enough food is the biggest when it comes to putting on weight as a skinny guy.

For a little while, I stopped focusing on this one critical factor and noticed it was significantly harder to get enough food in.

When I started prioritizing food first thing in the morning, it became much easier to eat enough food.

The longer you delay putting food in you, the smaller your ""eating window"" for the day is.

If you wake up at 6:45am and start eating at 9am versus 7am you've lost 2 hours off your eating window.

Those 2 hours are a great opportunity to take in 500-800 calories and start your day off with a bang!

426,iBznPAx6ZJY,Dutch Foods To Try,"Dutch Foods To Try - There are a lot of delicious foods to try in The Netherlands so we put together our own little DIY Dutch food tour to try as many as possible. 

One special Dutch food to try in The Netherlands is poffertjes - also known as the world’s cutest little pancakes. They are teeny tiny, fluffy, and melt in your mouth. They taste heavenly and you shouldn't miss trying them because they are seriously delicious and unique. I loved seeing how they’re made fresh to order in a poffertjespan. I found watching how they are flipped over super quickly was a bit hypnotic. You can get them with all sorts of toppings. My personal choice was chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. You generally order these by the dozen and you could eat as many and hardly notice because they’re so light and airy, unlike American pancakes. These Dutch cuties were one of my favourite things we tried in The Netherlands. 

A lot of Dutch snack foods are deep fried. One of the most popular is called a frikandel. It’s basically a minced-meat, skinless sausage that’s deep fried. Very similar to a hot dog. Personally the best part of this snack for me was the sauce. The ‘frinkandel speciaal’ is eaten with mayonnaise, curry ketchup, and chopped onion. It has a nice sweet taste. 

Another popular Dutch snack food is called a kaassouffle (cheese souffle). It’s melted cheese, usually Gouda, inside a doughy wrap that’s then deep fried. Cheese is important in The Netherlands and eaten widely. I have yet to see a Dutch refrigerator without a huge block of Gouda in it. Along with the poffertjes, the kaassouffle was my favourite Dutch snack food we tried. It’s pretty much deep fried cheese so what’s not to love?

Krokets are a Dutch food you’ll see everywhere and they look similar at first glance to a kaassouffle. A kroket is usually cylindrical and filled with meat. As you might have guessed, it’s also deep fried. It’s long been an economical way to use leftovers of meat stew and roasts which are then mixed with gravy, rolled into logs, breaded, and fried. It became really popular during World War II as a cheap food. It’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Stroopwaffel is quintessentially Dutch. It means syrup waffle and is made by baking a thin waffle and, while it’s still warm, breaking it in two. Then a warm caramel-like filling is added before the two halves are pushed back together, using the syrup as glue. They’re very popular to eat on their own or with other sweets. 

We also tried Surinamese and Javanese food, which is widely available in The Netherlands. Suriname and Indonesia were colonized by the Dutch and I was excited to try this type of food as I had never seen it before. My sample dish came with chicken, potato, hard boiled egg, noodles with peanut sauce, rice, vegetables and bread. For dessert, we had a deep fried banana with peanut sauce. I also tried a Surinamese soda called Cherry Bouquet but it was way too sweet for me - even though I have a massive sweet tooth. 

I included fries in this video even though they’re Belgian, not Dutch. But they’re really popular in The Netherlands and I didn’t think I could make a video about foods to try there without including fries. Make sure you try them with lots of different sauces. My favourite is truffle mayonnaise followed closely by curry mayonnaise. 

I hope that you enjoyed seeing these different Dutch foods to try in The Netherlands. I’d love to know which food you’d most like to try if you had the opportunity. Or, if you’ve already tried them, which is your favourite?

Subscribe to American Eye 

7. Unpasteurized Milk
Most of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860’s and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case, it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it’s from the mom to the offspring

6. Rhubarb
You might remember having a warm slice of rhubarb pie over at grandma’s house but she might have been keeping a little secret from you. Rhubarb must also be cooked very precisely or it could end up being lethal, there are typically high levels of Oxalic acid which can lead to kidney failure and other painful side effects. Hopefully grandma doesn’t change here recipe too much next time you're over there. But seriously though, it would take approximately 11 pounds of rhubarb leaves to cause such side effects.  

5. Blackberries
We highly suggest not eating just any berry you come into contact with. Many can be poisonous, but if you’re able to spot the right ones, go ahead and have yourself an all you can eat buffet! Wild blackberry plants are a tasty fruit but examine the flower carefully. The flower on the plant should have 5 white petals, like you see in this photo. The ripe ones become a deep purple and will be sweetest in comparison to the red ones. Feel free to eat the leaves as well and turn them into a tea with boiling water which can be used as a mouthwash. 

4. Japanese Mutant Veggies
 The disaster that claimed 18,500 lives is causing radiation in groundwater creating mutated vegetables like you never could have imagined in your life! Going to a farm here is like going to a plant freak show. Check out this monstrous head of cabbage. Here you see the difference between a normal sized cabbage and the Japanese mutant cabbage! You gotta really hope they don’t put some of this in your sushi! This is tomato is bubbling with tumors and is far from what we expect a normal one to look like. Don’t forget about this 5 fingered tunip that looks like the hand of a zombie! This sunflower has another sunflower growing out of it! What is going on here!

3 Bamboo
Although bamboo would be considered to be a primary food source for panda bears, humans should not consider eating this stuff raw. Golden lemurs and pandas have evolved to be able to eat enough cyanide which would be able to kill several  humans. You do not have this evolutionary trait, so don’t eat it. Cooked bamboo on the other hand has been known to be consumed at various restaurants but the pickled variety has led to fatal poisonings. If you’re looking to by some, make it’s not toxic first!  

2. Radiated Fish
This is actually more of a problem than you would like to believe especially in places like the chelyabinsk oblast region in russia and in places near the fukushima power plant. Some fish have been found with riddled with tumors and it’s not something you want to eat. Any body of water that is exposed to toxic nuclear waste has a good chance of contaminating fish there. Back in the earlier days of toxic waste disposal, they would simply put it in a barrel and throw it overboard into the sea. The sellafield decommissioning site is located right next to the Irish Sea, so much of the fish living there are questionable as well. Newer generations of mutated fish become more and more shocking, especially this one found in a lake in argentina. It was caught near a nuclear powerplant in this country and it broke the web.   

1.Farmed Salmon
Some researchers believe that farmed fish are actually the most toxic food in the world and it’s quite frightening. Fish farmers in places such as norway have been revealed in documentaries that farmed fish contain a shocking amount of pollutants and chemicals, making it the most toxic food in the world. Graphs revealed that in this case the fish had 5 times as much toxins than anything else found in the supermarket. Experiments were done on mice that revealed some very disturbing results to test mice. It made them obese with diabetes in comparison to normal food. Some believe the key factor is the food that is fed to the fish which make them much larger than normal So eat farmed fish at your own risk!",Food
