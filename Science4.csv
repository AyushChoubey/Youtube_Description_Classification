Clues are mounting that the rules governing the subatomic realm may play an unexpectedly pivotal role in the visible world. Join leading thinkers in the emerging field of quantum biology as they explore the hidden hand of quantum physics in everyday life and discuss how these insights may one day revolutionize thinking on everything from the energy crisis to quantum computers.

The World Science Festival gathers great minds in science and the arts to produce live and digital content that allows a broad general audience to engage with scientific discoveries. Our mission is to cultivate a general public informed by science, inspired by its wonder, convinced of its value, and prepared to engage with its implications for the future.

John Hockenberry's introduction 

Participant Introductions 

How is there a convergence between biology and the quantum? 

Are particles in two places at once or is this based just on observations? 

Are biological states creating a unique quantum rules? 

Quantum mechanics is so counterintuitive. 

Can nature have a quantum sense? 

The quantum migration of birds... With bird brains? 

Electron spin and magnetic fields. 

Cryptochrome releases particles with spin and the bird knows where to go. 

How is bird migration an example for evolution? 

photosynthesis and quantum phenomena. 

Bacteria doing quantum search. 

Is quantum tunneling the key to quantum biology? 

What are the experiments that prove this? 

When fields converge how do you determine causality? 

We have no idea how life began. 

Replication leads to variation which is the beginning of life? ",Science and Technology

- Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis.

In the lungs there is exchange of gases and the oxygen rich blood from here travels to the heart again through pulmonary vein.

👉 You take the courses after any class, you must make sure that the courses which h you are taking, is up to the mark with your interest else that will be is useless.

👉 students generally ask which are the best courses available after 12th science with Biology or with Mathematics. Most of the students who are having Biology in 12th standard, they ask questions about the courses available other than MBBS. We are providing career counseling material which will clear all of your doubts related to science with stream.

👉👉What to choose as a career after 12th Science is the biggest question that runs in every students mind. Parents too loose their peaceful sleep after their child clears 12th science board exam. Actually there are hundreds of options available to the students of 12th science stream. But without proper knowledge and guidance about the right option it does become difficult and confusing for both the students and their parents to select the suitable option for a bright career.

Clues are mounting that the rules governing the subatomic realm may play an unexpectedly pivotal role in the visible world. Join leading thinkers in the emerging field of quantum biology as they explore the hidden hand of quantum physics in everyday life and discuss how these insights may one day revolutionize thinking on everything from the energy crisis to quantum computers.

The World Science Festival gathers great minds in science and the arts to produce live and digital content that allows a broad general audience to engage with scientific discoveries. Our mission is to cultivate a general public informed by science, inspired by its wonder, convinced of its value, and prepared to engage with its implications for the future.

John Hockenberry's introduction 

Participant Introductions 

How is there a convergence between biology and the quantum? 

Are particles in two places at once or is this based just on observations? 

Are biological states creating a unique quantum rules? 

Quantum mechanics is so counterintuitive. 

Can nature have a quantum sense? 

The quantum migration of birds... With bird brains? 

Electron spin and magnetic fields. 

Cryptochrome releases particles with spin and the bird knows where to go. 

How is bird migration an example for evolution? 

photosynthesis and quantum phenomena. 

Bacteria doing quantum search. 

Is quantum tunneling the key to quantum biology? 

What are the experiments that prove this? 

When fields converge how do you determine causality? 

We have no idea how life began. 

Replication leads to variation which is the beginning of life? ",Science and Technology

- Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis.

The superior and inferior vena cava are the blood vessels which carry carbon dioxide rich blood from the different body parts to the right atrium and right ventricle. 
From here, this blood goes to the lungs via pulmonary artery for purification. 
In the lungs there is exchange of gases and the oxygen rich blood from here travels to the heart again through pulmonary vein. 
The oxygen rich blood reaches the left atrium and left ventricle. 
From here the aorta and the other arteries carry oxygen rich blood to the body parts and the cycle begins all over again.",Science and Technology

Hello students, here in this video we are going to learn the topics such as, what is nutrition, Needs of nutrition, modes of nutrition, autotrophic mode, heterotrophic mode, carnivores, herbivores and omnivores, the structure of leaf and stoma.

What are Life Processes?

Life Processes - Life processes are the processes going inside living organisms to sustain life. 
For example, Reproduction, Excretion, Respiration, and Growth.

Properties of Living Beings Compared to Non-Living.
- Movement
- Grow
- Need Food
- Excrete
- Respiration
- Reproduce

Nutrition - The process of taking food inside the body and converting it into smaller molecules which can be absorbed by the body is called Nutrition.

The need for nutrition: Nutrition is needed to provide energy for doing any activity and provide essential nutrients for life processes.
Nutrients: Materials which provide nutrition to organisms are called nutrients.

Types of Nutrients – 
- Carbohydrates
- Fats
- Proteins
- Vitamins
- Minerals

All the above-mentioned topics are described in an interactive and efficient manner so that the students could easily understand them.
