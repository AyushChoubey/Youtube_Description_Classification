72,VeQQCNiQ8Q,Audi Cars Manufacturing Process,"Audi Cars Manufacturing Process
Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data ‚Äì the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data ‚Äì will facilitate data‚Äëdriven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future ‚Äì from the application of virtual‚Äëreality glasses to metal 3D printing.

Modular assembly.
The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.

Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines ‚Äì in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems ‚Äì it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.

Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Gy≈ër, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.

At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by ‚Äúarculus‚Äù ‚Äì a startup company established a few months ago.

The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.
The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi‚Äôs ‚ÄúTechnology Development Production Assistance Systems‚Äù department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‚Äësoftware development processes.

The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.

The Audi Production Lab.
The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‚ÄëLab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process ‚Äì often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‚Äërobot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.

The projects currently running in the P‚ÄëLab include two big‚Äëdata projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future ‚Äì with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.

Toolmaking.
Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi‚Äôs Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‚Äëmetal parts.

The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‚Äëmetal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",Manufacturing

It is the moving component that is contained by a cylinder and is made gas-tight by piston rings. In an engine, its purpose is to transfer force from expanding gas in the cylinder to the crankshaft via a piston rod and/or connecting rod. In a pump, the function is reversed and force is transferred from the crankshaft to the piston for the purpose of compressing or ejecting the fluid in the cylinder. In some engines, the piston also acts as a valve by covering and uncovering ports in the cylinder technology connections technology information milling machine aerospace global technology metal lathe",Manufacturing

134,F5LVBW1vl8,Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now,"Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.

The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‚Äòpeel‚Äô into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.

This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. 

Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July ‚Äì 12 November 2017)

162,IZgLquI,How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process,"In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas:  

When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. 

Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:   

The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. 

Step 1: T-Shirt Design 
The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.

Step 2: Pattern Making
Once the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. 

Step 3: Sample Cutting
Once the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. 

Step 4: Sewing The T-Shirt
After the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won‚Äôt be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. 

Step 5: Mass Production Cutting
As soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. 

Step 6: Mass Production Sewing 
Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. 

Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line Distribution
The last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing. As a clothing business you also have to think about how you will provide quicker shipping, handle returns and manage employees. Randy Pinter Head of Warehouse Distribution drops the knowledge on what it takes to run this facility.

182,DGogf0AhFNE,Camfil Absolute manufacturing process,"Whatever your needs, there is an Absolute filter for you. Of course, each and every filter offers first-rate quality and top performance.
     Is price most important? Or is it essential that the filter can handle a high airflow? Or that it has a specific structure or design? Maybe you're looking for a filter that has a low pressure drop, so that it ""consumes"" less energy?
     From a sustainability point of view, all Absolute filters are an excellent choice. They have all been developed to be energy efficient and to last for a long time. And when it is finally time to change the filter, it is fully recyclable (it can be either crushed or burnt). Absolute filters are available with wood, plastic or metal frames.

Over the years, the art of filigree has remained alive as a distinctive symbol of the regions of Gondomar, Viana do Castelo and P√≥voa do Lanhoso. Portuguese filigree is an essential accessory and a mark of social distinction, being mostly used in special events such as weddings or popular festivals.
 
In Viana do Castelo, a bride has not only an astonishing pair of sterling silver Queen Earrings (it is said that they brought fertility to the wearer) but also two or more gold necklaces around her neck, with at least one heart-shaped pendant. Even Sharon Stone uses breathtaking filigree pendants made by one of our artisans.
 
Our filigree jewellery items are not just full of tradition, they are delicate work about fantasy rather than reality; they intrinsically belong to you and describe yourself as a woman. Which type of person are you? Creative ‚Äì Criativa in Portuguese? In love - Apaixonada? Fearless - Audaz?
