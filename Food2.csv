1,rQSMcU_IRQ,"San Diego Food Tour - MASSIVE BURGERS and CRAZY TOSTADAS in California, USA!","►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts and caps available now: 

Thank you to my sister Pam and brother in law Derek for joining me on this food tour of San Diego, California! And during the video I said Oceanside once, but I meant *Ocean Beach. We were on a family vacation in California, but on one day, we decided to go on an ultimate San Diego California food tour. It was a lot of fun, and you’ll find all the information of all the places we ate below:

Breakfast at Northside Shack - We started off in the morning, and first headed to Northside Shack to try their highly rated açaí bowl. It’s a laid back kind of spot, and I ordered the $11 bowl which was the large size. The acai is frozen into a sorget, and then they layered it with granola, about 12 different kinds of fruits, and nuts and seeds. It was delicious and refreshing, great way to begin this food tour.

Hodad's - Probably one of the most legendary of all restaurants in San Diego, California is Hodad’s serving massive double bacon cheeseburgers, and classic American food. The original location is located in Ocean Beach, and it has so much character, plastered with graffiti and stickers. Derek and I each ordered the double bacon cheeseburger, which is a monster burger. It takes some strategy to eat, but it was well worth it. It’s a delicious burger, and I also really enjoyed the onion rings. Price - $14.25

Blue Water Seafood Market & Grill - Pam and Derek had been here before and they knew it was good, so it was a restaurant in San Diego that I was looking forward to trying. You stand in line, order at the counter, and then find a seat. They offer fresh fish of the day, everything very fresh. We started with some oysters and the main dish, which was the best dish of the meal for me was the blackened black seabass. Delicious food, one of the best restaurants I ate at in San Diego. Total price - $65.23

Communal Coffee - Next we stopped to have a quick avocado toast and coffee. It was my first avocado toast at a restaurant, and although it was a little dainty, it was pretty awesomely delicious, a real treat. Price - $26.02 for everything (I think 3 coffees and avocado)

Nine Seas Seafood - Home of the Crazy Tostada, this seafood food truck is a gem of Mexican seafood. We ordered a few ceviches, not knowing how enormous the crazy tostadas were. They were huge, and packed with just about “everything from the sea.” But not only were the crazy tostates huge and crazy, but they were delicious, especially loaded with salsa. Total price - $24.75 for everything

And that completes this San Diego food tour. It was an amazing day and the food was delicious!

6,D59Ld3KKM6M,LONDON STREET FOOD,"LONDON STREET FOOD, Southbank Centre’s food market offers fantastic street food, a great range of beers, wines and cocktails, delicious coffee, tea and sweet treats – with a selection of fresh produce to take home, and guest traders each week. All our stallholders are committed to providing food that bursts with fresh, vibrant flavours, inspired by cuisines from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. No wonder SCFood Market is one of London’s top food destinations.

You can find the market on Southbank Centre Square each weekend including bank holidays and for an extended market at the end of summer.

What’s to eat?
Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.

Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.

Cristian’s family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.

Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.

As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go. If the weather’s hot, why not try their range of ice teas and iced chai latte all summer.  The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you’re getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.",Food

8,C5U3dMkYbog,"GIANT BEEF RIBS and Brisket - AMERICAN FOOD BBQ at Little Miss BBQ in Phoenix, AZ!","Little Miss BBQ serves unbelievable BBQ meat in Phoenix!
►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts available now: 

Phoenix, Arizona, USA

For me, one of the ultimate American food meals to eat is awesome BBQ - when the meat is smoked perfectly so it slides off the bone, and the flavor is packed full of insane smokiness. My brother in law Derek had already been to Little Miss BBQ, but it was my first time to eat here, and I was so excited.

I arrived a little over an hour early to get in line, but luckily as soon as you pull up you get a number so that you don’t actually have to wait in line the entire time. 

Scott and the entire crew at Little Miss BBQ are amazing, and you can immediately feel their passion and their genuine love for what they do and for the people they get to interact with everyday as a result of serving the best BBQ in Phoenix! Scott and his wife have an interesting and amazing grassroots history and start to their BBQ business. They first started making BBQ at home just because they loved doing it. Eventually they started competing in American BBQ competitions. At the beginning things didn’t go so well, but they kept going and perfecting their BBQ recipes and eventually started to win some of the competitions. Eventually they opened Little Miss BBQ, and it’s one of the best BBQ spots you’ll ever eat at.

So after getting the full tour of the restaurant and all the smoked meat, it was about time to open. You line up outside and the actual inside is quite small - most people either takeaway or eat outside.

I wanted to try a little of everything, so we got a giant tray of smoked BBQ meat including pork ribs, pulled pork, turkey, sausage, brisket, and beef ribs, with sides. Total price for the entire tray came to $92.70 - that was a lot of meat!

Thanks to my brother in law Derek for coming out to eat as well. We started with the beef ribs, and those are the best of the best. The meat falls apart and it was so insanely juicy and flavorful. The BBQ brisket will also blow you mind with its massive meaty flavor and juiciness. Finally my other top meat was the sausage, including jalapeno and a mix of meat and bacon.

Lastly, you have to eat your American food bbq feast with their famous pecan pie. And even though I’m not into sweets, a few bites at the end was amazing.

Little Miss BBQ is a phenomenal BBQ restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona. Not only will the quality and taste of the meat blow you away, but the passion of Scott and the entire crew are so genuine and so friendly, and that’s what makes it so good.

Thank you for watching this BBQ video!

13,SkJaKAaRWn,New York City Food Tour : HUGE Pastrami Sandwich at Katz’s Deli and The Halal Guys!,"Join me on this delicious New York City food tour!
►Check out my NYC food guide: https://goo.gl/xubRjU
►Get a t-shirt here: https://goo.gl/3dV4uu

New York City is an incredible food city because of the diversity of the food available. On this New York City food tour we started off the day by going to one of the most famous restaurants in NYC, Katz's Delicatessen to eat pastrami. Next, we ate at a restaurants in New York City Chinatown called Spicy Village for an amazing pan of “Spicy Big Tray Chicken,” and for dinner I had chicken over rice from The Halal Guys, one of the most popular New York City street foods.

 Katz's Delicatessen - There are few places in New York City for food as famous as Katz's Delicatessen, an absolute legendary deli in the city. Although it’s well overpriced, because it’s such a heritage NYC institution, it’s one of the must eat restaurants in the city. I arrived early in the morning, hoping to beat the crowds, which I did (go for breakfast if you want to avoid lines). After a little contemplation, I decided to go for the reuben with pastrami and a half of corned beef. The corned beef was alright, but the reuben with pastrami was incredible. Total price - $48.56

 Spicy Village - Next up on this New York City food tour my wife and I walked around New York City Chinatown and eventually found our way over to a restaurant called Spicy Village (thanks to Monty for this recommendation). The one dish I mainly wanted to eat at Spicy Village was the Spicy big tray chicken, a pan of fried chicken parts and noodles in a spicy and mouth numbing broth. It was everything I had hoped for and more, and it was one of the best foods I ate in New York City! Total price - $22 - But along with the spicy big tray chicken we had an extra dish as well. 

 Times Square - One of the busiest and most recognized squares in the world is Times Square in New York City. So in the afternoon, happy and full of Spicy Village and Katz’s Deli, we walked over to Times Square to enjoy the people watching and the ridiculous amount of lights and action.

 The Halal Guys - While walking through Times Square I remembered that one of the most popular New York City street food stalls wasn’t too far away. So we walked over to The Halal Guys, and I ordered chicken over rice. The chicken over rice itself is prepared pretty plain, but the flavor in The Halal Guys is all in the white and red sauce, both of which are incredibly flavorful and delicious. It was my first time to eat at The Halal Guys, and I’m pretty happy I did. Chicken over rice - $7

It was a great first full day in New York City with some incredibly delicious food. Probably my favorite dish of the day was the spicy big tray chicken from Spicy Village, but all the food was so food.

►T-shirts and caps available now: 

When Chef Liz and Will invited me to hang out with them and go to some of their favorite restaurants in LA, I was very excited. We set off to eat some amazing food in LA area including tacos, Armenian kabobs and Chinese savory pies.

Featured in this video, and huge thanks to:

Liz Johnson: 
Will Aghajanian: 

Teddy’s Red Tacos: 
Armin from Mini Kabob: 

Jeffrey: 
Barbara: 

Teddy’s Red Tacos - The first place we ate on this best of Los Angeles food tour is Teddy’s Red Tacos. First of all, Teddy is such a friendly down to earth guy who is passionate about birria, one of my favorite Mexican foods. Serving out of a food truck, we ordered the mixed plate of birria tacos, his made with beef. It was extraordinary, and great to hang out and meet Teddy as well.
Mixed plate - $10

Beijing Pie House - Next we drove East to the Beijing Pie House, another one of Liz’s best favorite restaurants in LA. We ordered a mix of dishes including a variety of dumplings and the highlight was their tripe salad laced in Sichuan pepper oil. If you’re looking for some Northern Chinese dishes, Beijing Pie House is well worth the drive from Central LA.
Total price - $55.70

Mini Kabob - There was one more huge meal we had to eat on this best restaurants in LA food tour. We drove to Glendale where there’s a large population of Armenians, and we met up with Armin, son of the owner of Mini Kabob. Immediately I loved the place, family run, just a small little shop with a few tables, and an ultimately friendly place. They welcomed us in and Armin took care of us from the start, fixing us a mixed meat platter with a little bit of everything. The Armenian kabobs were spectacular, as were all the different salads.
Huge platter - thanks Armin!

Heroic Deli - Finally, to end this restaurants tour of LA, we drove over to meet my friend Jeffrey who is starting a deli in LA called Heroic Deli (). Barbara prepared us their signature OMG classic Italian sub, which was unbelievably good and well balanced. When they open in Santa Monica, be sure to stop by for a fantastic sandwich.

Thank you to Liz and Will for taking me around to some of their favorite restaurants in LA, I had an amazing time!

15,AQIExuYef3Y,In-N-Out Burger VS. Five Guys (American Fast Food Review!),"In-N-Out Burger or Five Guys? Leave a comment now!
►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts available now: 

Phoenix, Arizona

I’ve eaten In-N-Out Burger before and I’ve eaten Five Guys before… but this was my first time to ever eat them back to back. In this video I’m taking you on a full burger review comparison between In-N-Out and Five Guys, two burger chains with extremely loyal followings.

In-N-Out Burger

I ordered the Double Double and extra crispy fries. Now to keep things consistent for the review, I couldn’t go all crazy with their secret menu of toppings, so all I ordered was extra onions.

Prices - Double Double - $3.85, Extra crispy fries - $1.80

The Double Double from In-N-Out is indeed extremely tasty and salty and it has an amazing balance of tastes and everything goes together in such harmony. However, after finishing the Double Double I walked away still quite hungry.

Five Guys

Next we drove over to Five Guys, luckily just a 5 minute drive from In-N-Out Burger. Again, I kept it pretty simple and just ordered their cheeseburger all the way, and a side of regular fries. You’ll notice immediately that the prices are twice as high as In-N-Out, however, we’ll find out that their burger weight probably twice as much as well.

Prices - Cheeseburger - $7.99, Fries - $4.29

The Five Guys Cheeseburger is heavy and dense, and they already press down the bun for you, so it’s not fluffy at all. The ingredients inside are great, and I especially enjoyed the mushrooms inside. The burger is definitely not as salty as In-N-Out, however it tastes better quality.

VERDICT:

It sort of depends on what mood you’re in, and you do have to take into account that Five Guys is twice as expensive as In-N-Out - so you could eat two Double Doubles for the same price as one Five Guys cheeseburger.

I think the In-N-Out Double Double is tastier, possibly because it’s saltier, but the Five Guys burger tastes fresher, more natural, and a little more home-cooked styles. Overall, I would choose Five Guys more often than In-N-Out Burger. That’s my final verdict.
What about you? I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below!

Likely the Biggest Grocer in America.. http://www.1ownercarguy.com The Supermarkets were doing something Right Lately though... in USA the .99 Cent stores and Walmart have really put the Squeeze on the Traditional Grocery Store and The Stock is Very Depleated etc. All of that aside it is pretty much still the way we but our food in America. After making many trips to the Netherlands and seeing all the differences in not only the size of the store but the Diif selection, Prices etc etc it really got me to thinking and i made a video in Holland to show Shopping there at the Albert Hein Market....So why not Albertsons in California..;-) Well really though i ended getting an awaful lot of requests from Europe to show a Store here in the States so here you go!

23,TeLiBBxI,Foods You are NOT Allowed to Eat In the USA !,"Whether it’s rotten cheese consumed by maggots, or mysterious brownies that make you really sleepy, here are foods you’re not allowed to eat in the US

Subscribe to American Eye 

6. Mirabelle Plum
Don’t get caught acting suspicious around the police if you got a few of these illegal plums stashed on you! These plums you see here are grown only in the Lorraine region of France and people from the US won’t get to taste them unless they travel to western europe. You’re probably thinking, “what’s the big deal”? They’re just plums for crying out loud not an endangered species or anything. It’s somewhat of a mystery why exactly they’re banned but the answer seems to come down to money. In order to protect the financial income of the eastern province in France, most countries have agreed not to sell them. It’s a little bit similar to how we have to have the differences between Champagne and Sparkling water. Whatever the reason exactly might be, you aren’t allowed to eat them, cuz we said so! 

5. Unpasteurized Milk
Most of the milk we drink and the cheese we eat must go through a process known as pasteurization first before we consume it. The process was introduced by Louis Pasteur in the 1860’s and This kills the bacteria and other microbes which would be harmful for consumption . not only that but this allows for it to be stored on the shelf longer. Although some states allow the sale for raw milk 17 states have banned it. Those who are in favor of non pasteurization claim that the milk loses many of its nutrients once it goes through the process.  But those who claim pasteurized milk is the way to go state that too many diseases are spread from just raw milk. In any case, it is probably best not to drink raw milk unless it’s from the mom to the offspring

4. Lazy Cakes
This cakes are banned in arkansas and strangely enough, they might actually make you feel lazy. The brownies are laced with melatonin and are known to cause severe drowsiness. Melatonin is often used as an over the counter sleep supplement and typically isn’t found in our food. Rumors went on full effect when people started saying that they put some type of synthetic cannabis substance in there but in any case they will make people sleepy. Maybe people who sell them don’t realize they’re not your average brownie, and you have to kind of read the fine print to find out. 


3. Pig’s Blood Cake
Who on Earth would eat something that sounds this horrifying? If you guessed the Taiwanese, good job! Pig’s blood cake has been banned in the US due to sanitary reasons and whatever other reason they find is fine by me. No need to guess what the secret ingredient is with this one. It’s basically like a street food delicacy that’s made with soy broth, sticky rice and oh yeah, pigs blood! The rice is then dipped in blood and deep fried. Other ingredients might be used to coat the deep fried pig blood on a stick but once you eat it, you have to live with yourself! Supporters of the treat claim there is no sanitary issues with the preparation process but it’s still banned here!


2. Conch Queen
This beautiful shellfish becomes actually pretty tasty once you open it up and eat it. The conch queen is a banned food in the US to import mostly because overfishing threatens its existence. It’s actually more like a giant sea snail which has a very sturdy shell. The caribbean is the main exporter of conch meat to the us and demand for it quite high and the US is responsible for 80 percent of the consumption of this endangered creature.  


Purple Mangosteen 
One forbidden fruit that you probably shouldn’t eat or at least be aware of is the purple mangosteen. This is a highly sought after fruit which which a delicacy in thailand must be destroyed completely if it’s found in the US! The problem isn’t that it’s a rare fruit or anything but the goal isr to keep the asian fruit fly out, which is responsible for complete destruction of some crops. The tropical species has already wreaked havoc on the state of Florida and we don’t want this thing in our country! It’s been notorious for attacking over 400 different species of fruits and vegetables.",Food

27,H6KhSyxFa5U,10+ Popular Foods Around the World That Are Different in the US,"There’s nothing better than some pigs in a blanket on game day, chips on the side, and a big apple pie for dessert, eh? Now, whether you’re American or not, could decide how you just imagined all those fun foods. When it comes to all things culinary, America has always had a way with food. Even when the rest of the world has established a specific term for a delicious dish, when they’re in the States they might need to dig deeper to find the right words to order what they really want to eat. 

From Great Britain to Australia, there are many food items that differ from those in the USA. Here're the main things from America’s menus that have really confused the rest of the world and we’ll present them to you right away to save you from having a food panic attack during your next trip around the world.

SUMMARY:
- Before they were officially dubbed “pancakes” in America, they used to be called “Indian Cakes.” Crepes, on the other hand, have nothing to do with pancakes in terms of origin since they date back to 13th-century France.
- American “toast” is just a toasted piece of bread. But if you’ve ever had French toast, well, you know it’s a sweet delight of white bread soaked in a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.
- If you’re in the UK, pigs in a blanket would involve wrapping hotdogs in bacon. Now here’s where it gets trippy: the equivalent of American pigs in a blanket is called a “sausage roll” in the UK. 
- Bacon in the US comes from the pig’s belly and is served in thin crispy strips coated with fat. In the UK, “bacon” is from the pig’s back, and it’s less fatty, thicker, chewy, and served in round slices.
- Americans will imagine a creamy custard dessert when they think of pudding. If you were to travel to the UK, you’d get something way different. The British definition of pudding is anything that’s been boiled in something else. 
- In some parts of Europe, they leave the original coating on the eggs,  and that coating protects them from contamination. In other parts, they vaccinate hens to keep the eggs disease-free.
- When we ask for breadsticks in an American restaurant, we get soft pieces of doughy bread and garlic that we can dip in sauce. But if you were having lunch in an Italian restaurant and asked for breadsticks, you’d actually get the original version of “grissini” – crispy baked breadsticks that can accompany your salad or be crunched on as a snack on its own.
- Ketchup is another one of those culinary items that got lost in translation. In America, you know that familiar red paste made from tomato, vinegar, sugar, and all the accompanying spices. However, if you go to Australia and ask for ketchup on your burger, the waiter might give you a funny look and say, “You mean tomato sauce?” 
- What people in the UK call “chips” are what Americans know as “French fries.” On the flipside, in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, what we call chips (the round things sold in half-empty bags), they call crisps.
- In most other English-speaking countries except for Canada, cookies are called “biscuits.” In fact, they only use the term “cookies” to describe the chocolate chip ones in particular. 
- If you’re in the UK, you’re probably imagining me hopelessly trying to spread some Jell-O on my bread because for you, “jelly” is my Jell-O and my “jelly” is your jam!
- If you love American Milky Ways, wait until you try the European version! It’s also made of chocolate and nougat, of course, but it doesn’t have that layer of caramel in it.

28,TvfePq94NUg,Pike Place Market - AMERICA'S #1 CHOWDER + Must-Eat Market Tour in Seattle | American Food!,"►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe
►T-shirts and caps available now: 

Pike Place Market is a landmark of , and one of the oldest continuously functioning markets in the United States. I had been there once before when I was a kid, but this time I was on a mission to go on the ultimate Pike Place Market food tour!

In this video you’ll find some of the best food within the market and all the details about what to order and eat when you’re in Seattle, Washington. One tip - go early to start eating before the main huge rush comes - when it gets to mid-day, the market is packed.

Here are all the restaurants we tried at :

Lowell's Restaurant - For breakfast we went to the legendary Lowell's Restaurant, serving a mix of classic American food including seafood. I wanted to try their dungeness crab eggs benedict, which was a little expensive, but pretty good.
Dungeness crab eggs benedict - $25

Pure Food Fish Market - Next to Lowell’s don’t miss the smoked salmon. Again, it’s not cheap, but it’s so good, salmon glistening and embedded with smoke.
½ Pound salmon - $16.56

Ghost Alley Espresso - Next on this Pike Place Market food tour I was in desperate need of a coffee to begin the morning so we navigated our way past the gnarly gum alley to Ghost Alley Espresso. Great place for a quick cup of espresso.
Doppio espresso - $3

Piroshky Piroshky - A legendary bakery that serves mostly Russian influenced baked goods, both sweet and savory, is Piroshky Piroshky. Again, I tried to keep it pretty classic, and Seattle style, so Jason and I split the salmon pate piroshky. It was very tasty, with a cream cheesy taste.
Salmon - $6.85

Pike Place Chowder - Having won every chowder competition and award in the US as possible, Pike Place Chowder serves America’s #1 Chowder. So you know you can’t miss it when you go to Pike Place Market. We got in line about 20 minutes before they opened and line didn’t take long. You order, get your chowder, and then sit down. I don’t have too much experience with chowder, but indeed it was good, and I also really liked the seafood bisque.
Total price - $37.76 total

Beecher's Handmade Cheese - Another classic is Beecher's Handmade Cheese where you can sample cheese curds and also order grilled cheese sandwiches.
Flagship sandwich - $7.49

Ellenos Real Greek Yogurt - They also have a very loyal following and for sure it’s some of the best yogurt I’ve ever tried.

Market Grill - Finally to end this Seattle food tour we stopped at Market Grill, right in the heart of the market and I ordered the grilled salmon plate. Overall, it was good, and a perfect ending to this extreme food tour!
Grilled salmon plate - $15

30,5RwIWGkMxrE,How Corporations Ruined Food (Food Industry Documentary) - Real Stories,"When we walk into a supermarket, we assume that we have the widest possible choice of healthy foods. But in fact, over the course of the 20th century, our food system was co-opted by corporate forces whose interests do not lie in providing the public with fresh, healthy, sustainably-produced food.

Fortunately for America, an alternative emerged from the counter-culture of California in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where a group of political anti-corporate protesters–led by Alice Waters–voiced their dissent by creating a food chain outside of the conventional system. The unintended result was the birth of a vital local-sustainable-organic food movement which has brought back taste and variety to our tables.

FOOD FIGHT is a fascinating look at how American agricultural policy and food culture developed in the 20th century, and how the California food movement has created a counter-revolution against big agribusiness.

The American dinner plate is deficient in nutritious produce, and part of the problem is cost. Because diets low in fruits and vegetables have serious consequences, health advocates have tried to incentivizes Americans to choose apples over donuts for years but with little success.

In the US, a nation with high rates of diseases such as obesity and diabetes , a variety of strategies - from a junk food tax to a produce prescription program - are now being tested. But there are a number of factors that still stand in the way of Americans having healthier, more affordable produce and dietary options.

45,lwgXXVXM3I,"Fast food, Fat profits: Obesity in America | Fault Lines","Obesity in America has reached a crisis point. Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. 

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

People featured in this film: Marion Nestle, Marlene Schwartz, John Bode, Nelson Eusebio, J. Justin Wilson, Dr. Olajide Williams, Lauren Von Der Pool, Julie Paradis, Cathal Armstrong, Ed Bruske,

57,FGe3KhkNx,"Mouthwatering INDIAN STREET FOOD Breakfast Tour - Puri, Sabji & Raj Kachori | Jorhat, Assam, India","Subscribe to my channel ► http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB 
Check out my blog ► http://davidsbeenhere.com/ 

In March of 2019, I took one of my favorite trips of all time when I traveled to northeast India and spent two weeks exploring the states of Assam and Meghalaya. What I found there blew my mind. The people, culture, and food were so different from what I was used to in India. My time there really broadened my mind about what India is. I hope you enjoy watching these videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

Follow Rishi on Instagram: www.instagram.com/collosal_appetite

After arriving in Jorhat the previous evening and going on a nighttime street food tour, I linked back up with my boy Rishi the next morning to go on a phenomenal Indian breakfast street food tour. I was hungry, so I couldn’t wait to eat some amazing street food!

We kicked off our tour at a small, cozy spot called Laxmi. There, Rishi and I got some puri and sabji that contains chickpeas and potatoes. The puris are nice, crispy, and flaky and the sabji is so flavorful and has nice chunks of potato in it. I added some spicy chili chutney to give it a nice kick. I also got some chai, which I let sit for several minutes to let it cool off. It was super frothy and creamy but needed to sit for a little longer.

I love to make mini tacos with the puri and sabji. They’re so good together. The dish comes with three puris, so you get more than enough to finish off your sabji, but you can always get more. Everything was so good that I got a second helping of all of it, including the chai! Our total came to 70 rupees (or just over $1 U.S.) for both of us together. What a deal!

From there, we got back on Rishi’s scooter and headed to a local market. The streets were pretty wild! There were people, cars, and cows everywhere! The shop Rishi took me to didn’t have a name. There, we got rotis and more sabji. This sabji came with a lot more chickpeas and less potatoes than the first one and was served with a spicy chutney on the side. It also contained greens, which was different.

The chutney was different and not as spicy as the last one. It contained some fruits and veggies and was really nice. It was almost like a salsa! I wasn’t a huge fan of the roti (I actually preferred the puri from the last place) but the sabji was amazing! It only cost 25 rupees, or about $0.36 U.S. 

Before our next food spot, we stopped at a Rajmao Pukhuri, a huge pond in the center of Jorhat. This pond is man-made and was constructed by the Ahoms. There are no turtles or ducks there, but there are fish in its waters!

From the pond, we set off to our next destination. Jorhat was an interesting place. It wasn’t small, but at the same time, it wasn’t huge either. My hotel was in the central business district but we were making our way through the suburbs where people live. There were lots of vendors selling fruit and clothes by the side of the road.

We arrived at Crunchy Bites to have some raj kachori. I’d never had it before. It’s a big, crunchy kachori that’s stuffed with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, sev, white sauce, tamarind chutney, and masala. It’s an amazing-looking chaat and it tastes as good as it looks! It didn’t contain any spice but had tons of flavors, including something similar to sour cream and the sweetness from the tamarind chutney.

I loved breaking pieces of the kachori into the filling and eating it all together. It was so yummy and filling! It was the best thing I ate that day but I was too full to finish it! The raj kachori only cost 60 rupees, or $0.86 U.S.

Next, we visited an inexpensive central market. You have to cross a bridge to get to it. The market contains six different lanes and lots of tiny stalls, some of them only 5 feet in width. I couldn’t wait to do some shopping!

There were lots of clothing shops, as well as others selling jewelry, shoes, and backpacks. There was a stall selling spices and mouth fresheners as well as onions and peppers. There were lots of spice shops and others selling flattened rice. There were also tailors. This place is only visited by locals, so it’s a real, immersive experience!

I hope you enjoyed coming along on my breakfast street food and market tour in Jorhat! If you did, please give it a thumbs up and leave me a comment! And please subscribe to my channel so you don’t miss any of my upcoming travel/food content!

70,LQyH1FM9Yy8,How Much Food Prices Will Rise After Midwest USA Floods (804),"The biggest floods to hit the USA Midwest crop growing belts since 1993 and 1927, this appears to be the largest event event ever recorded in that area of North America in the last 150 years. Since the trade war with China, more 6.7 billion bushels in storage of the 17 billion bushels total has been lost due to flooding and contamination. Going by 1993 price rises after the flood a jump of 30% at the minimum is forecast. Global grain production down 7% over the last two years and poor conditions in the fields will make refilling the silos difficult at best.

87,jcS-eG3-7q0,USA: Rev. Jackson brings food to activists occupying Venezuelan embassy,"Subscribe to our channel! rupt.ly/subscribe

Civil Rights activist Reverend Jessie Jackson arrived outside the Venezuelan embassy in Washington DC on Wednesday, to deliver food supplies to the four remaining activists who are occupying the building.

Reverend Jackson's act follows reports suggesting that authorities shut down the water in the embassy and also prevented the delivery of food and medical supplies.

Footage from outside the embassy shows the activists sticking out the windows and lowering down a basket with the use of a rope. After having it filled up with sustenance, the activists pull it back up. In total, the activists reportedly received four baskets with food provisions.

""Let us remain non-violent and focused. Let us not engage in violence, even violence rhetoric. Our mission is to pull the sides together, not to expand war,"" said Reverend Jackson.

Minor scuffles broke out when a pro-Guaido protester attempted to grab the ropes of the basket from Jackson's hands, to prevent him from delivering the goods. Police officers were quick to intervene and separate the sides.

Activists have been occupying the embassy since April 24 as an attempt to prevent the US from handing the embassy over to Guaido's representatives.

Venezuela has been in political crisis since January 23, when opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself president in a move now recognised by over 50 countries including the United States and the European Union.

Millions of hungry locals and wide-eyed tourists take to the streets to eat tacos, down bacon-wrapped hot dogs and indulge in the latest offerings from a fleet of gourmet food trucks and vendors. Dating back to the late nineteenth century when tamale men first hawked their fare from pushcarts and wagons, street food is now a billion-dollar industry in L.A.—and it isn’t going anywhere! So hit the streets and dig in with local food writer Farley Elliott, who tackles the sometimes dicey subject of street food and serves up all there is to know about the greasy, cheesy, spicy and everything in between.",Food

111,-XJGD6OQ-zE,Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America,"A new book by OC Weekly Editor and food critic, and frequent KPFK guest host, Gustavo Arellano, explores the history of it came to be that Mexican food is now as American as pizza. Arellano, whose nationally acclaimed syndicated column Ask a Mexican! was the basis of his earlier book, expresses his exhaustive research of Mexican food in the US, in his signature humorous style. 'Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America' is a story of the chili queens of San Antonio and the tamale Kings of Chicago, of the Mexican origins of chocolate and vanilla, of the the invention of tacos, taco frying machines, and the rise of Taco Bell. Ultimately, it is an exploration of the unquenchable national thirst for tacos and burritos, or at least ""gringo-ized"" versions of foods that may only remotely resemble their Mexican counterparts. Even though the great American past time of vilifying immigrants continues unabated, how is it that Mexican food, representing the culture of the most dominant and most deported immigrant community, continues to be consumed with such gusto?

Uprising host Sonali Kolhatkar interviewed Gustavo Arellano on April 25, 2012 about Taco USA.

9 million gallons of warm mineral water flowing daily
51 minerals; highest healing mineral content in the USA
87 degrees - perfect for swimming and soaking!

Healing Waters
Warm Mineral Springs is a naturally formed warm water mineral spring. Its temperature is a consistent 87-degrees year-round. Experts agree that this is the ideal temperature for soaking and swimming. Being a warm spring, one receives the health benefits of both a hot spring and a cold spring. Swimming in the warm mineral water at Warm Mineral Springs is both healthy and rejuvenating for your body.

Warm Mineral Springs' water has the highest mineral content in America and ranks as the third highest mineral content in the world! There are over 51 different minerals found in the rich water at Warm Mineral Springs, each one having its own unique health benefits that are absorbed naturally through your skin, helping to re-mineralize one's body and promote health and healing.

Chemical analysis of the water reveals a total mineral content of 17,439 parts per million. This is many times the mineral content of such famed international spas as Vichy and Aix Les Bains in France, Hot Springs in Arkansas, and Baden Baden in Germany. The Warm Mineral Springs' mineral density results in high buoyancy for bathers, which helps to facilitate effortless swimming and the joy of weight-free movement.

Interesting Notes
Warm Mineral Springs is the only warm water mineral spring in the State of Florida, and is the largest warm water mineral spring in the world! The surface area of the spring is a round pond, it is 1.4-acre in circumference and reaches depths of nearly 250 feet deep in the center. The hourglass shaped sinkhole (or cenote) is the results of an apparent earthquake that created the subsurface cave-in some 20,000 years ago. At about 45 feet below the surface there are small ledges that encircle the basin, some of which contain shallow caves. Beneath these ledges the springs body expands to form a large cavity where, at about 148 feet below surface, debris accumulates and forms a Debris Cone that is thought to be over 30,000 years old. (The oldest lowest stratum of rock is estimated to be 20 million years old.) The limestone bedrock, from which the sinkhole is formed, comes from marine rock. United States Geological Society Hydrologists found the porosity of the limestone formation allowed water interchange with the ground water. Water samples collected from the Floridian Aquifer have revealed that the underground water may have taken 60,000 years to filter through the earth before reaching the surface. The discovery of stalactites and stalagmites found in the caves below the spring&aposs surface indicates that the underwater caves were once dry, probably during the last Ice Age.

The spring&aposs main water source originates from over 3,000 feet deep within the earth, connecting to the Boulder Zone of the Floridian aquifer, which is located, some 100m below the present land surface. It produces an astonishing nine million gallons of mineral rich water everyday, as a result, this creates a fresh clean body of water ever two hours!

Nearer to the Surface
A curiosity of The Springs is that the water contains no dissolved oxygen, except at a layer at about 15 or 20 feet thick at the surface, as a result, only a few small minnows mange to live near the waters edge.

A unique characteristic of the Springs' water is that the anaerobic, antibiotic, and high mineral content, act to preserve most non-metal objects that have fallen or been placed into the spring. Because the water contains no dissolved oxygen; neither oxidative process nor fermentation takes place, making the water an all-natural preservative.",Food

Subscribe: https://goo.gl/cv6b96
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Meat, milk, cereal, and fruit are products Americans consume on a regular basis. But did you know that some of these products are completely banned in other countries? They contain substances and chemicals that might be approved by the FDA, but are illegal by any other food administration. Let’s explore 10 foods banned in other countries!


Let’s start with artificial dyes. You probably know that M&Ms and other sweets contain artificial dyes that contribute to the product’s color and make it more appealing. But those dyes have been banned in Europe and many other countries around the world and replaced with natural dyes as they contain several harmful substances!

Wild salmon is considered as one of the healthiest foods with plenty of nutritional benefits. But did you know that many countries banned farm-raised salmon? Wait until you hear just how harmful salmon is for the environment and why it’s been banned in Australia as well as New Zealand!

We often hear about zero-calorie chips which are considered healthy. It’s due to a fat substitute called Olestra. But this substitute seems to have negative effects on our health! While it removes fat from products, it actually stops the body from receiving some of the most essential vitamins and nutrients, which is why it was banned in Canada and Europe.

Do you consume meat, Rice Krispies, sports drinks, calorie-free snacks, fruit, or GMO food? All of those have been banned from countries around the world because they include harmful substances that have negative effects on your health!

172,guxledYcXcE,Processed Food Documentary - Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs,"Processed Food Documentary: Processed Food vs. Nutritional Needs.

The human body runs on food.  Once, food shortage was the major concern.  After the second world war, technological advances in food production led to a new era, that was characterized by an overabundance of inexpensive food, and relatively little physical activity.  In the decades that followed, other sociocultural shifts continued to contribute to the changing way we ate.  Women who had previously controlled most of the average family's food preparation now entered the workforce in significant numbers.  And the processed food industry began to capitalize on our need for fast, convenient food.  

This meant that fewer meals were being cooked at home.  And since convenience foods were generally higher in calories than home-cooked meals, the average person's caloric intake increased dramatically.

Maya Adam, MD, is waging a battle cry against one of America’s most critical – and challenging – public health crises of our generation: childhood obesity. A lecturer at Stanford School of Medicine and in Stanford University’s human biology program, she is leading the cause through education.

#10 Prime Meat
The prime cut meats that smaller restaurants and corporations sell are one of the biggest complaints that high-end chefs and physicians make. That’s because ‘prime cut’ suggests that it is a single cut of the best meat from the animal.
But this isn’t the case in many restaurants. Actually, what if I told you they chop up all the leftover meat and glue it back together? Does the word transglutaminase ring a bell? This is the name for the meat glue they use to glue the low quality meat back together to make you think you’re getting a full piece. This is more than a lie, this is disgusting. 
Besides the fact that it is using the worst tiny cuts of meat, it’s made from ammonia. The stuff used in fertilizers and oven cleaners. They try to fight back by claiming it kills E Coli, which should not be something we should be worried about being on meat anyway. Justifying making people unknowingly eat ammonia just so they can pass off scrap meat does not seem ethical in the least. Be very careful where you eat your steak! See, this is why being a vegetarian seems like a safer option! Or maybe seafood….
#9 Imitation Crab
Or maybe not seafood. For one, crustaceans feed off the worst possible debris on the bottom of the ocean. The only nastier creature is shrimp. This stuff they eat doesn’t magically disappear when they are caught and cooked either. There’s still…stuff in it that we eat…secondhand.
Nevertheless, it’s expensive to buy fresh crab and shrimp, but you can get crab cakes and other delicacies at the grocery store for a pretty good price. Why? It’s usually because it is fake, under the guise of imitation crab meat.
Imitation crab meat is made from the remains of other fish that are mushed together, and injected into a mold. They mince and mince random fish, whatever they can get their hands on, until it turns into the same texture as crab. It is then created into a paste that is frozen and then shaved into crab-like flakes. To make it taste like crab, they just add flavor and paint it to look like crab. 
So, next time you go for some cheap crab, remember that’s probably, beaten, frozen, shaved, and painted fish remains. I kind of like imitation crab but not really a fan of this process...it still tastes good so if you’re okay with this…then go ahead. 
#8 Parmesan Cheese
Parmesan cheese is delicious! Especially, real authentic parmesan cheese. But did you know that companies will usually lie about what’s in “parmesan”?
The FDA regulations make it legal to sell fake Parmesan cheese. This is some scary stuff. There are two huge deal breakers with parmesan. One is grated parmesan in the shaker. Most of the time, cellulose and mold inhibitor chemicals are added so it won’t clump. Cellulose, not cellulite, that’s just an after effect. Cellulose comes from ground up wood pulp and is considered “harmless and organic matter”. 
They usually add 2-4% cellulose, but the FDA doesn’t restrict it. In fact, some has been proven to carry 20%! That’s a lot of cellulose on your pasta! 
The saddest part is, this is just allowed in the United States. Parmesan cheese legally means the kind of cheese that comes from Parma, Italy. But in the US, you can call it parmesan when it’s just dehydrated, grated mozzarella.
This is like the Kobe beef of cheeses. Most of the time, when you get parmesan, it’s not parmesan. It’s cellulose and a mixture of cheap cheeses.
#7 Egg Substitute
This one is a little different. No one knows what it is, but many believe that it’s a great substitute for people with egg allergies. But really, it’s still just eggs. 
They take mostly egg whites, fresh, frozen, or powdered, and add other ingredients. But not much. They actually just contain 99% egg whites! There’s not actually much substituting going on. It might be easier for people who don’t want to go to the trouble dealing with egg shells and yolks slipping everywhere, etc. 
In reality, it is called egg substitute because of that 1% that’s just artificial coloring,  salt, onion powder, and who knows what else. Why? Why would they just flavor egg whites? “Egg substitute” is kind of misleading and should be for people with egg allergies who need a substitute. It shouldn’t just be eggs. 
Maybe it’s substituting something else? Is it the bottle substituting for the shell? Bottom line is…this isn’t egg substitute, it’s just expensive eggs.",Food

From raw materials to finished products, FOOD FACTORY goes behind the scenes to reveal how our favourite foods are made: With a daily output of 14,000 two-inch candy balls, the tumbling room of a jawbreaker factory is so loud it sounds like a jet engine; every cup of Tim Hortons coffee starts at the company's mammoth roasting facility where super-sized grinders tackle thousands of pounds of beans per hour

FYI covers a range of stories and experiences that reflect how people actually live their lives today, not defined by just one passion or interest. Visit us at FYI.tv for more info.",Food

196,2MKfTUB0p0,EBT Food Assistance Shut Down USA will Mimic Global Food Shortage Reactions (770),"With EBT food assistance programs set to cease payments Feb 01, 2019 as Trump squares off with Democrats, neither willing to give an inch, it will come down to the people to decide which sides policies is correct to get the government open again and food assistance flowing again. Sudan experiencing bread shortages as the economy collapses, so this in my opinion is a dry run for governments across the world to see how citizens will react to food shortages, American style !

231,LwBUfB7hU6A,The race to save endangered foods,"Wild animals aren’t the only ones facing extinction.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

We’re letting foods we’ve eaten for thousands of years disappear from farmers’ fields, and from our plates. Saving them isn’t just a matter of cultural preservation. In the next 30 years, we’re going to need to learn how to feed more people on a hotter planet, and the more genetic varieties we lose, the harder it’ll be to adapt. 

To learn more about the foods facing extinction in the US and around the world, check out the Ark of Taste, a project of Slow Food USA.

Journalist Mark Shapiro’s book, Seeds of Resistance, goes into much more detail about the risk that genetic homogeneity poses to our food supply. He also profiles some of the efforts, many led by indigenous communities, to preserve older seed varieties. 

For more on seed relabeling, check out the Farmers Business Network’s 2018 Seed Relabeling Report.

The chart on declining global yields for corn, wheat, and rice comes from an article in the academic journal Disasters and Climate Change Economics from agricultural economists Mekbib G. Haile, Tesfamicheal Wossen, Kindie Tesfaye, and Joachim von Braun. Their prediction model takes into account both climate change and price volatility, which is why their estimates are higher than those of some other researchers. 

Special thanks to Marie Haga of Global Crop Diversity Trust, and Marleni Ramírez of Bioversity International for sharing their knowledge with me.
