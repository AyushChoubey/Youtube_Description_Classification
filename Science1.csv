22,EpTFQcD7bME,'Making' - the best way of learning science and technology | Manish Jain | TEDxPanaji,"Manish Jain an IIT Kanpur and Stanford University alumnus demonstrates with working models how science and technology can be made fun to teach and learn. In this talk he takes the audience on a journey of 'MAKING' as a process for learning. He firmly believes this approach can revolutionize learning since toys speak the language that children understand. Manish is an IIT Kanpur alumnus. A chance meeting with Padmashree Arvind Gupta triggered him to dive into the space of popular science education full-time. Manish currently heads Creative Learning Initiative (CLI) at IIT Gandhinagar which aims to provide an ideal space and environment to learn and understand concepts joyously. His goal is to ignite interest, inquisitive spirit, and scientific temper to nurture inherent creativity and passion for science and technology among all. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",Science and Technology

#12 3D Printing Organs
3D printing has been around for a few years now, but it just recently made breakthroughs bigger than cars or phone cases or toys that have been created before. The 3D printer has started created organs for human use. 
Sure, prosthetics are understandable. But organs? Research is currently being conducted on artificial heart, kidney, and liver structures, as well as other major organs. Organs like the heart will be tougher but it is definitely possible. Can you imagine being the person that kept organs in stock? Checking your list...okay I need to print three kidneys and four livers today. 
The reason the 3D printing works so well is that organs are very complicated and the machine does a layer by layer scan of an actual organ. This allows them to give a very detailed printout.
Crazy yes. But not as crazy as the ability to print out human skin! Now that craziness is happening as we speak! This can be to repair damaged skin or purely cosmetic reasons. 
#11 Needleless Vaccines 
What is your least favorite part of getting flu shots? Oh yeah, the shot. The needle that pierces your skin and stings.
This new invention called the ImmunoMatrix patch will allow you to vaccinate yourself with a simple band-aid like patch. This isn’t just great because it’s painless but has even greater benefits. One: It takes a tenth of the vaccine that the syringe does, which saves tons of money. And two: it doesn’t require the glass vial, syringes, hypodermic needles, trained medical personnel, and biohazardous waste disposal. So again, it saves tons and tons of money.
Can you imagine it being flu season and you just going to town to pick up your flu patch and adhering it at home? Dream big…and realistically! This is happening.
#10 Endless Storage
You know how a terabyte is really big? Well what about a million terabytes? Maybe a trillion? Okay, now imagine an endless amount of storage! 
Scientists at the University of Southampton have created and are working on advances with this technology. Not only will this device store endless info, but it is pretty much invincible to damage.
It is made out of nanostructured glass and has the ability to record and retrieve five dimensional digital data by femtosecond laser writing.
As for right now, it can only hold about 360 TB, but things are quickly escalating there. It can go through almost 2000 degrees Fahrenheit and will last longer than anyone on this planet…except maybe the tardigrade. 
The technology isn’t for public  use yet because it is reserved for preserving historical documents first, since it can hold an entire library of books! They have already stored actual copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Newton’s Opticks, Magna Carta and Kings James Bible. 
#9 Wall Climbing Fish
Ever seen a spider climb a wall? What about a monkey? Hmm…well, what about a wall climbing fish?
In the Amazon rain forest, just recently, a wall climbing fish has been discovered. This may not seem like a scientific advancement, but in reality, it means everything! This isn’t the only thing odd about these fish, who were oddly enough born in caves only they could see and we’re colorless! 
This Ecuadorian fish defies gravity as it hikes up a nearly vertical wall for ten feet!
It’s called a Chaetostoma microps, and is a suckermouth armoured catfish. You’ve seen suckerfish climb underwater, but out of water is a whole new thing! Scientists are ecstatic to study the technique and maybe use it to create wall climbing gear for engineers. 
Another thing that makes this discovery an advancement is that it has never been seen in this exact way before. Meaning, it has either learned the ability on its own, as a species, or…there are still many more species still undiscovered by scientists. 
#8 Cybernetic Implants
The term cyberware is a pretty new field for scientists. Sure, the first pacer was implanted in the 1950s, but that was such a small advancement compared to today. 
We already have an “artificial pancreas” for diabetics. As of now, it is simply a pod implants into the skin by the wearer and pumps insulin into their body. But you see, there are two types of cyberware today.  Brainware and bodyware. You know the datajack from The Matrix? Yeah, like that.

38,FRQnL2IWCXk,Fifty Years of Chinese Science and Technology,"Prof. Geoff Oldham reflects on his experiences over fifty years, starting with this first visit to the Chinese mainland in October 1964 when he wrote in Science magazine of “the beginning of the Chinese scientific revolution”. He recalls decades of collaborative work between SPRU and Chinese institutions through the 1970s and 80s, including research conducted on technology transfer in the oil industry and in the area of ‘clean coal technologies’, links between provincial level research and policy making, and his contributions to policy evaluations in the 1980s and 1990s that saw him working alongside Chinese and international colleagues and reporting directly to the Minister of Science and Technology. Tracing China’s changing science and technology policies from the early focus on self-reliance to the ‘catching up’ of the reform and opening period that paved the way for China’s emerging leadership and current patterns of international collaboration, his talk charts the country’s ongoing transformation and the changing role of science and technology within it. It alsos provide an account reflecting on personal memories that have shaped Professor Oldham’s perspectives on this process. 
The talk was part of the China Sussex Seminar Series ",Science and Technology
39,dbo_wbfRZm0,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,"It’s an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new “things” and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ’90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you’re a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we’re being over-dramatic, then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we’re not exaggerating at all.

Music: 


SUMMARY
-Granodiorite rocks can easily be carved using temperature techniques. Hundreds of stone spheres were found quarried in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. Researchers even saw a gigantic ball weighing over 16 tons.
-The Roman dodecahedron had 12 flat pentagon-shaped faces with a knob protruding on each corner. It might have been a dice, a kid’s toy, a candle holder, a simple decoration, a measuring device on the battlefield, or an astronomical instrument, to name a few.
-The Phaistos Disk was made from clay and measures about 6.2 inches in diameter. Experts concluded that it was a prayer to an ancient Minoan goddess.
-The formula of Greek fire was a well-guarded state secret for over 7 centuries. Greek fire was used in naval warfare.
-Blades made from Damascus steel were the most sought after in medieval Europe. And that’s because they were the best swords at the time.
-The Iron pillar of Delhi dates back to the Gupta period, which lasted from about 240 to 590 C.E. A small amount of rust has started to form, but it is strange that there isn’t more.
-Viking Ulfberht swords are believed to have been made around 800 to 1,000 C.E., but experts were sure that the technology used to make swords of such extraordinary quality didn’t come around until 800 years later.
-The Voynich manuscript has 240 pages broken up into four sections: herbal, astrological, balneological, and pharmacological. There have literally been dozens of failed attempts to crack this thing.
-In 132 C.E., Zhang Heng, a Chinese inventor, astronomer, engineer, scientist, scholar, and artist, invented a seismoscope and presented it to the Han court as an instrument for measuring seasonal winds and the Earth’s movements.
-The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved by a group of divers in 1900 and has been dubbed “the world’s first analog computer” and it was made around 200 B.C.E.

67,MpoQX5rTs0k,SECAF Remarks on Science and Technology Strategy at Air Warfare Symposium,"“We’ve been working on a new science and technology strategy and it’s almost done. Instead of looking at where potential adversaries are heading, or coming up with the same list of technologies that we’ve come up with to research over the last 20 years, the Air Force Science and Technology strategy will seek to predict where adversaries cannot easily go and ensure that the Air Force gets there first. We will focus on advancing technology solutions along five strategic capabilities. To move the Air Force from a current force challenged by increasingly sophisticated adversaries to a force that dominates time, space and complexity in future conflict.

Global persistent awareness, resilient information sharing, rapid effective decision making, complexity, unpredictability in mass, speed and reach of disruption and lethality – those concepts must drive our research as they drive our way to fight. We must think and innovate faster across these capabilities to create multiple dilemmas for our adversaries.”",Science and Technology

A large group of science, technology and innovation studies scholars is making a significant contribution to the report Rethinking Society for the 21st Century, produced by the International Panel on Social Progress. The Panel seeks to answer the question: Can we hope for a better society in the very challenging context of a series of system crises, growing inequality and climate change? To answer this question the IPSP has mobilised hundreds of social scientists (including economists) to provide answers and to deliver a report. It will have 22 chapters and address major issues, including: Social Justice, Inequality, Cities, Jobs, Markets, Finance, Corporations, Democracy, Sexuality, Violence, Wars, Peace and Security, and Multiple Directions of Social Progress. In the final chapter the report will discuss the contribution of social sciences to policy and institutional change.

  * ""Metallurgical Engineering""
Metallurgy is a domain of materials science and engineering that studies the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, their intermetallic compounds, and their mixtures, which are called alloys. Metallurgy is also the technology of metals: the way in which science is applied to the production of metals, and the engineering of metal components for usage in products for consumers and manufacturers. The production of metals involves the processing of ores to extract the metal they contain, and the mixture of metals, sometimes with other elements, to produce alloys.

STS combines history of science, philosophy of science, sociology of science, science policy, science communication and other fields into one combined field of study. We look at how science shapes the world, and how the world shapes science - and we use approaches from the humanities to understand how science interacts with society. 

UCL Department of Science and Technology Studies offers two undergraduate degrees. History and Philosophy of Science, and (new for 2019) Sociology and Politics of Science - as well as MSc and PhD level study.

Interested in finding out more? Watch some of our other videos where we look at specific examples, discuss the modules on offer from our department, or watch our JBS Haldane public lecture series to really get a feel for what a degree in STS would be like.

Lecture Abstract:  
As human population is growing faster than ever, access to reliable and sustainable energy has become one of the most important problems in the 21st century. Access to energy resources will influence and shape the future of human society as we go forward. The cost and availability of energy significantly impacts our quality of life. While most people in industrialized countries have easy access to energy more than two billion people are still relying on solid fuels like wood for cooking and heating. There are also environmental issues to be considered in our efforts for exploration and utilization of new sources of energy. Microwave remote sensing techniques have been very successful for measuring and monitoring many environmentally important terrestrial parameters such as soil moisture, biomass, ocean wind and salinity, etc. However, until recently such techniques have not been exploited for subsurface sensing. In this talk a number of recently developed radar remote sensing techniques will be presented to demonstrate the potential of microwave remote sensing techniques in exploration of fossil fuel resources. A dual frequency synthetic aperture technique will be presented that allows for mapping the sand layer thickness over bedrock to assist with successful seismic tests. Also, a borehole subsurface synthetic aperture imaging concept is presented that facilitates mapping the extent of the subsurface fracking region in shell rock. Monitoring the extent of fracking region is of great importance for optimal utilization of oil/gas wells and to ensure the fracking region is far away from the aquafers.
