We love abstract art as it is the perfect choice to decorate your home especially if you prefer a modern or minimalistic home design. Abstract art is a way to express your feeling without any special skills as you do not need to follow and guidelines. You can choose any color or form as there is no limitations just pure freedom. Moreover, you can use different unexpected tools to express your creativity. One of the easiest and popular kinds of art if fluid art. It takes only a few steps to create a masterpiece. Besides, it’s a really cool way to paint as you even don’t need brushes instead you can use a hairdryer, a mop and a piece of cardboard. So, you don’t need to have special art skills, take a canvas and acrylic paints and start creating a masterpiece. The main idea of fluid art is the process of pouring paints onto a canvas and spreading paint without a brush. The first step is to take a plastic cup and pour layers of different paint colors in it. Place canvas on top of your cup and carefully flip the whole thing over. Use a hair dryer to spread the paint over the canvas. Now you have a cool decoration item!
If you love impressionism, you can try to paint a picture using…a mop! Yes, it sounds crazy, but watch our tutorial and you will be surprised by the method.

Art is very beneficial for child development. Painting helps to relax, get rid of stress, concentrate, and last but not the least, it helps to develop fine motor skills and creativity. Today, we collected the best and the most fascinating art ideas for kids. I think you should try them all and tell us what you liked most.

The first painting is for those who love Japanese art. It's an incredibly beautiful painting – looks adorable and it may look good in any room (all you have to do is to try and play with different colors).

Crayons are amazing for painting! I bet, we'll show you some amazing hacks that you didn't know before. Amazing landscapes are waiting for you to repeat them! Choose what you like more – an evening forest or a lonely lighthouse in purple sunset waters. You can even learn how to draw a UFO abduction. 

You can draw amazing pictures using ink and water.

The following activity is really exciting! Have you ever heard of thread painting? This type of art and craft is really exciting – you never know the result. Try to do this with little kids and you'll see how excited they can be.

Watch this video up to the end and see how to paint animals out of words.

40,WsSqxqwIkwM,30 FUNNY FINGER ARTS AND CRAZY DOODLES,"It turns out that you can have fun without getting up from the couch and without gadgets! Did you know that you can draw on your own fingers so that it brings joy and fun? See how to do it. You can make a whole finger theater with your child - come up with banned characters and an interesting plot: about love, about crime, about the Apocalypse. 

How to teach a child to draw animals? Especially if you yourself are far from an artist? I will show you how to draw animals simply and fun. Drawing with the palms is a great educational activity for children, from which they will be delighted. See how to draw a bird, how to draw a giraffe, how to draw an ostrich, how to draw a peacock, how to draw a turtle, how to draw a snake, how to draw an elephant, how to draw a snail. 

You will draw adult animals, and the kid, due to the size of his palm - their children. You should have a whole zoo. For example, to draw a giraffe, we press the middle finger, the rest we take to the sides and draw around. It remains to decorate and get a giraffe with horns and ears.

A MAKEUP artist with bones as fragile as glass is on a mission to challenge the representation of disabled women in the fashion industry. Cary Velazquez, 29, from Ponce, was diagnosed with Osteogenesis Imperfecta three days before she was born. The disease, often referred to as ‘brittle bones disease’, is a genetic disorder that affects the strength of the bones. Cary began professionally doing makeup three years ago, after feeling inspired by beauty videos on YouTube.

Candace Worth founded Worth Art Advisory in 2001 to bridge the gap between contemporary art collectors and the increasingly exclusive art world establishment. Candace began her career in the Contemporary Art Department at Christie's auction house in the early 1990s. Since then, she has worked for a blue-chip gallery in New York City as well as an internet-based art consultancy. She now buys artwork for a highly diverse group of clients at all price levels, sourcing most of the work from across the United States and Europe. Candace currently serves on the board of the Drawing Center in New York City and has lectured on issues related to the contemporary art market at several art institutions, including the Rhode Island School of Design. Candace received her BA in Art History from the University of Pennsylvania and continued her studies in Art History at the Graduate School of Arts at Columbia University. worthartadvisory.com

94,7U67IDe46KU,STILL - The Thing About...Art & Artists - Donna Huanca,"Donna Huanca is a multi-disciplinary American artist who works nomadically, and has chosen Berlin as her base. Creating artwork with media including performance, installation and sound, she explores cultural hybridity by deconstructing them and recreating her own ceremonies. Materials like discarded clothing and second-hand fabric play a major role in her work. She interplays found objects from material culture which range from diverse
fabrics to metals that span from simple nuts and bolts to jewelry and silverware. Her work also includes organic elements such as dirt, smoke, and foods.  Clothing is a critical element in her work, because it represents the diversity and hybridity of culture today. The bright colors of the fabrics are evocative of ethnic clothing, sometimes referencing the tribal clothing of South America or rural Asia. Her portrait paintings are made of layered
scraps of clothing, fabric, fur or felt. While working, she uses cloth like paint by placing it on the canvas, whether that be a human body, a mannequin, or the wall. She controls the movement of the medium, but also lets it fall freely when necessary. 
As well as using models as elements in her works, she also places a level of importance on collaborative pieces, especially as installations and performance works.

108,V9RrO0dtu5M,How ancient art influenced modern art - Felipe Galindo,"View full lesson: http://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-ancient...

The term modern art sounds like it means art that is popular now, but the style actually originated over 150 years ago and includes artists like Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin. What’s more ironic is that this movement they pioneered – considered revolutionary at the time – was inspired largely by objects of traditional and ancient design. Felipe Galindo details ancient influences on modern art.

110,UPk56BR1Cmk,Why art is important | Katerina Gregos | TEDxGhent,"This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Katerina Gregos is convinced that contemporary art has an important role to play in society, as one of the last frontiers of free expression. Today, artists and cultural practitioners, rather than politicians, are leading some of the key discussions about the state of the world. Contemporary artists challenge each and every one of us to reinterpret social and political events, and crack cemented opinions as well as dominant narratives propagated by the media and those in power. As an internationally respected curator, Katerina has curated a number of exhibitions dedicated to exploring the relationship between art, politics, democracy, the new global production circuits, and human rights. Let yourself be inspired by Katerina’s talk at TEDxGhent 2014, and find out what contemporary art can contribute to society.

Independent curator and exhibitions organiser

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Arts and Music

120,kD7fQJFBuOM,My Art // Accepted RISD & PARSONS Portfolio,"This video was meant to be filmed months ago.. but y'all know me..

I wanted to get this up because there aren't too many videos around where people showcase their full college accepted art portfolios- notably for RISD and Parsons School of Design. When I was an applicant, I found videos like this very helpful (at least for my anxiety at the time) so I do hope that prospective RISD and Parsons applicants find this informative!

I applied to a total of 3 colleges in my senior year of high school, (Rhode Island School of Design, Otis School of Art and Design, and Parsons School of Design). All of the pieces featured in the video were sent in my college application, though some pieces are not shown and were only included in my Otis application. But my ENTIRE portfolio for RISD is up on here! Nothing left out. 

I didn't talk too much into the actual application process, and I didn't give as much advice as I wanted to. This video is more about showing my portfolio, and if needed, I can put another one up specifically talking about the HOW of applying to art schools. Any questions, just feel free to ask below.

A few people have asked me why skillshare over youtube and my answer is this: I'm not saying to only use one or the other. I just think skillshare is a great site to have all your lessons neatly wrapped into one place. I've learned sooo much more about Adobe Premiere from skillshare and I actually did learn how to make that pumpkin spice latte!!! I still use Youtube all the time for things, it's just the overall neatness of Skillshare that I appreciate. I just feel like I'm learning more all at once when I use skillshare. You'll see what I mean if you try it out. I often mix what I learn on skillshare with what I learn on YouTube. Both are great!

133,qyKXw24JX5g,8 Artists: Advice to the Young,"Watch, listen and soak in the words of 8 prominent artists, who have strong and diverse thoughts on what constitutes insightful advice to young artists.  

Serbian performance artist Marina Abramovich feels that it is essential to be ready to fail. South African artist William Kentridge believes that good advice has more to do with the interaction between the person giving it and the person receiving it. Rock singer and poet Patti Smith shares the advice that writer William S. Burroughs once gave her: to build and protect your name by producing good work, and eventually the name will become its own currency. American singer David Byrne emphasizes the importance of not undervaluing your own artistic satisfaction. German film director Wim Wenders stresses that you have to do what no one else can do better than you. Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson recommends that you are sensitive to your surroundings - and British artists Dinos and Jake Chapman cut to the bone.  

For full-length interviews with the above artists and more, have a look here:

141,ATZFjJA2iz,23 Amazing Street Art Magic,"From Indoor Swimming Pool to Hawaiian Waves here are 23 Amazing Street Art Magic

Subscribe to Talltanic 

10. Layered Illusion
 These colorful, layered illusions are popping up all over the place, but very little is known about their artist: someone who goes by the name of 1010. His signature style is to layer colors on top of one another in order to create an illusion of depth. His illusions are turning urban landscapes into incredible colorful caverns, but where they lead is just as mysterious as the artist himself.
 

9. Melting Paris
 From a distance, it looks like the plaster--even the windows and metalwork--is melting in the sun, right into the street below. The new facade brought surrealism to life and is the work of Pierre Delavie. Amazingly, this is all the work of illusion photography. An image of the building was distorted using Photoshop and then set over the building’s actual facade. This illusion stayed in place for an entire year in 2007.

8. Indoor Swimming Pool
 This installation was put in place by famous artist Leandro Erlich. There’s no need to worry, the people in the swimming pool aren’t in danger of drowning--in fact, they’re in an empty room, viewing the people above them. The illusion is created by suspending water between two transparent sheets of glass, only about 10cm thick. This way, it feels like you might dive right into the pool and swim to the people below, when in reality, you could walk across the pool safely. 

7. Nelson Mandela
 Viewed from its side, this sculpture appears to be nothing special. It is simply a collection of black poles or pipes. However, if you view them from the correct angle, they form the face of Nelson Mandela, a famous politician from South Africa. The sculpture can be found in South Africa, on the same spot where Mandela was arrested. This illusion is both striking and powerful, made up of a total of fifty unattached columns.

6. Tree, Line
 Zander Olsen’s photography project had a simple enough idea: wrap the trunks of trees to blend in with the horizon line behind them. Who knew the effect would be so incredible? By creating this relationship between the horizon and the trees directly in front of the camera, Olsen blends foreground with background and almost seems to make the sections disappear entirely.

5. Hawaiian Waves
 The story behind this larger-than-life illusion goes that while the artist, John Pugh, was working on this mural, a fire truck pulled up in order to rescue the children standing above the door. He had painted the children staring in awe at the wave, but had not yet painted the stairs you see now. Would you believe us if we told you that, in fact, the entire side of the building you see is perfectly flat? Even the two square windows to the right of the wave are painted on and if you look closely enough, there is a man standing in the top window, peering out at the surfer!
 

4. Cup of Coffee
 Manfred Stader specializes in a type of art called hyperrealism. This giant illusion is a perfect example, you can almost smell the freshly brewed coffee. Through an amazing talent, he was able to make it look as though the cup is made of real porcelain and there really could be a giant metal spool balancing on the saucer. In reality, the only real thing about this cup of coffee are the coffee grounds Stader is pouring across the foam.
 

3. Russian Caves
 As part of a series, Edgar Muller turned the streets of major cities into gorgeous lake-filled caverns. Covering over 100 square meters, this incredible illusion is another testament to Muller’s work. With this series of nature-inspired illusions, Mueller makes the viewer feel as though they can see right into the center of the Earth. 
 

2. Flying Tree
 Many street artists make attempts to add to their environments, but Daniel Siering and Mario Shu are taking something away. These incredibly talented street artists have used foil and cans of plain, old spray paint to create this fascinating illusion. By painting the image of the cloudy sky on the midsection of the tree, which has been covered in tin foil, these artists give the illusion that this massive tree is floating in midair. 
 

1. The Grass Globe
 This illusion, designed by François Abélanet, is so well-executed that even after some careful study, it is still difficult to figure out. Although it appears compact, the globe park is actually a massive installation, spanning over 300 feet in length. It took 90 people and five days to complete. It was designed using the idea of anamorphosis, which requires it to be viewed only from one, particular angle in order to look normal. From any other angle, this jaw-dropping illusion appears to  be a segmented grass dog park.",Arts and Music

兵者，詭道也。故能而示之不能，用而示之不用，近而示之遠，遠而示之近
""All Warfare is Based on Deception""
- 孫子(Sun Tzu)


The Art of War
by Sunzi (c. 554BC -- c. 496 BC)
Translated by Lionel Giles (1875-1958).

    ""The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise written during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics of its time. The Art of War is one of the oldest and most famous studies of strategy and has had a huge influence on both military planning and beyond. The Art of War has also been applied, with much success, to business and managerial strategies.""

At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Arts and Music

As technological advances mean that digital innovations are now pervading many more areas of our lives, the arts industry is starting to take the work of artists working in the digital realm increasingly seriously.

In the wake of the growing debate and critical examination of digital art, the British Council commissioned this short film, produced by Dezeen, to ask: What is Digital Art? And why should we pay attention to it?

The film features interviews with 15 Folds founders Margot Bowman and Sean Frank, curator and writer Conrad Bodman, and artists Jon Thomson and Alison Craighead.

… The business of being an artist and working with galleries
Alan K. Avery, owner  Alan Avery Art Company

Thank you to Charles Mitchell at Think Free Films for the video and editing! 

             
Art School: Is it worth it?
o You can learn artistic rules on the Internet, by job shadowing or joining an artist co-op. 
o You have to learn composition, perspective, anatomy, and color theory to become a successful artist. 
o You have to learn the rules in order to break them. 

Assessment of your talent: Why do you create your artwork? 
o Photorealism is a technique and anyone can learn a technique. 
o Great artwork is when you can bring incredible ideas and creativity together with incredible technique. 
o Have reasons and inspiration behind your artwork. 
Finding a Gallery
o There is a gallery for every artist. 
o Networking is the most valuable tool you have as an artist. 
o Be out in the artistic community and be seen. 
Challenging yourself 
o Being the top artist in a gallery is not necessarily the best for your career, long term. If you don’t challenge yourself, you will not experience growth as an artist. 
o Being around other great artists helps to elevate your work. 
• Rotating your artwork
o Rotate your artwork a minimum of three times per year in a gallery setting. 
o Keeping the gallery inventory fresh will benefit your chances of being show to collectors. 
Pricing
o You have to pay your dues, start low and work your way up the ladder. 
Social Media
o Once you start getting a collector base, they will find you on social media. 
o Put your best self forward, don’t air politics on social media. 
The Business of Art
o An art dealer has the lowest profit margin of any business , a 50/50 split with the artists is not unfair. 
o Galleries have to figure in the cost of running a gallery, hosting events and openings, and paying a staff. All of which comes from their 50% . 
o Discounting artwork devalues the art for the rest of the collection. 
o Many people have not been in an art gallery before. It is the gallery’s job to make people feel comfortable by speaking to and informing them about the art. 
Signing with a Dealer: Is it necessary?
o It depends on the type of career you want. You can show at art festivals, sell your work online, or sign with a gallery. 
o Brick and mortar galleries will stay in business regardless of the Internet. 
Serious collectors want in person advice for purchasing artwork
o Do not sign with an art dealer until you have gotten to know them and know it is the right gallery and experience for you. Research the gallery and the art dealer. 
Contracts
o They exist for a reason, to protect everyone involved. The reason for a contract is because an art dealer has been burned in the past and needs to protect their interests for the future. The same goes for artists, the contract is also there to protect your interests.  
o If you do not understand terms in a contract, ask the dealer for clarity. If you see something you don’t like in your contract, you can ask for a revision to suit your needs. Make sure that your contract is an agreement between you and your art dealer. Make sure to read your entire contract. Does the contract deal with insurance coverage, who pays for shipping, and payment dates if a work sells? 
o Know what your rights are before you approach a gallery. You have the rights to your work and how you are represented.

190,ZcFRfJb2ONk,Teaching art or teaching to think like an artist? | Cindy Foley | TEDxColumbus,"What is the purpose and value of Art education in the 21st Century? Foley makes the case the Art’s critical value is to develop learners that think like Artists which means learners who are creative, curious, that seek questions, develop ideas, and play.  For that to happen society will need to stop the pervasive, problematic and cliché messaging that implies that creativity is somehow defined as artistic skill. This shift in perception will give educators the courage to teach for creativity, by focusing on three critical habits that artist employ, 1. Comfort with Ambiguity, 2. Idea Generation, and 3. Transdisciplinary Research. This change can make way for Center’s for Creativity in our schools and museums where ideas are king and curiosity reigns.

Cindy Meyers Foley is the Executive Assistant Director and Director of Learning and Experience at the Columbus Museum of Art. Foley worked to reimagine the CMA as a 21st century institution that is transformative, active, and participatory. An institution that impacts the health and growth of the community by cultivating, celebrating and championing creativity. Foley envisioned and led the charge to open the 18,000 sq. ft. Center for Creativity in 2011. In 2013, the museum received the National Medal for Museums in recognition of this work. Foley guest edited and wrote chapters for Intentionality and the Twenty-First-Century Museum, for the summer 2014 Journal of Museum Education.

In 2012, Foley received the Greater Columbus Arts Council Community Arts Partnership award for Arts Educator. She was a keynote speaker for the OAEA (Ohio Art Education Association) 2012 Conference. She is on the Faculty of Harvard University’s Future of Learning Summer Institute.

Foley is a graduate of the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University. Prior to joining the Museum, she was with the Institute of Contemporary Art at the Maine College of Art, the Portland Museum of Art, and the Wexner Center for the Arts.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",Arts and Music
191,MJ9qSv5og_8,THIS MAKEUP ARTIST IS A MASTER OF BODY PAINT ILLUSIONS,"Mirjana Milosevic is a talented makeup artist from Serbia who creates amazing body paint illusions and is known by the nickname Kika.

Mirjana's parents said that she learned to draw before she learned to walk. She was drawing every day and on any surface that was available. When Mirjana was 11, her sister's friend asked her to draw a cartoon characters mural on his wall. The result was awesome, and she felt really happy doing it. 

She grew up in a country that was struck by war and it was a really hard time, so her parents couldn’t arrange for her to go to an artistic school. Mirjana spent all of her free time after school on improving her skills. 

Three years after graduation from high school, Mirjana gave birth to her son, Danilo, and motherhood gave her the strength she needed to start doing what she’d always wanted to do.

Mirjana became the most popular kids’ muralist in her country, but because of an accident with her spine she took a break. Doctors told her this was essential if she wanted to have more children.

In 2012, Mirjana gave birth to her second child, Nikola. Nikola inspired her to start doing kids face-painting, and she was very successful in that as well.

After that, she completed a basic makeup course and became interested in special effects makeup and body-painting. Now Mirjana is a fantastic body paint artist and creates amazing illusions.

She has won a lot of awards for her skills:

2015 – The Festival of Serbian Fantastic Film – The Oskull Award;

2015 - 3rd place at the International Face-Painting Competition in Serbia; 

2016 - 1st place and beauty vlogger of the year, NYX Face Awards Serbia competition;

2017 - 1st place at the International Face-Painting Competition in Serbia; 

Mirjana Kika Milosevic is one of the top ten illusionists in the world. Her makeup illusion videos are very popular on YouTube.

200,lNI07egoef,Why is Modern Art so Bad?,"For two millennia, great artists set the standard for beauty. Now those standards are gone. Modern art is a competition between the ugly and the twisted; the most shocking wins. What happened? How did the beautiful come to be reviled and bad taste come to be celebrated? Renowned artist Robert Florczak explains the history and the mystery behind this change and how it can be stopped and even reversed.

Script:

""The Mona Lisa""...  ""The Pieta""...  ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring.""  For a score of centuries, artists enriched Western society with their works of  astonishing beauty.  ""The Night Watch""...  ""The Thinker""...  ""The Rocky Mountains."" Master after master, from Leonardo, to Rembrandt, to Bierstadt, produced works that inspired, uplifted, and deepened us. And they did this by demanding of themselves the highest standards of excellence, improving upon the work of each previous generation of masters, and continuing to aspire to the highest quality attainable.

But something happened on the way to the 20th Century. The profound, the inspiring and the beautiful were replaced by the new, the different, and the ugly.  Today the silly, the pointless, and the purely offensive are held up as the best of modern art. 

Michelangelo carved his ""David"" out of a rock.  The Los Angeles County Museum of Art just offers us a rock, -- a rock -- all 340 tons of it.  That's how far standards have fallen.  How did this happen?  How did the thousand-year ascent towards artistic perfection and excellence die out?

It didn't.  It was pushed out.  Beginning in the late 19th century, a group dubbed The Impressionists rebelled against the French Academie des Beaux Arts and its demand for classical standards.  Whatever their intentions, the new modernists sowed the seeds of aesthetic relativism -- the ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" mentality.

Today everybody loves the Impressionists.  And, as with most revolutions, the first generation or so produced work of genuine merit.  Monet, Renoir, and Degas still maintained elements of disciplined design and execution, but with each new generation standards declined until there were no standards.  All that was left was personal expression.  

The great art historian Jacob Rosenberg wrote that quality in art ""is not merely a matter of personal opinion but to a high degree . . . objectively traceable."" But the idea of a universal standard of quality in art is now usually met with strong resistance if not open ridicule.

""How can art be objectively measured?"" I'm challenged.  In responding, I simply point to the artistic results produced by universal standards compared to what is produced by relativism.  The former gave the world ""The Birth of Venus"" and ""The Dying Gaul,"" while the latter has given us ""The Holy Virgin Mary,"" fashioned with cow dung and pornographic images, and ""Petra,"" the prize-winning sculpture of a policewoman squatting and urinating -- complete with a puddle of synthetic urine.

Without aesthetic standards we have no way to determine quality or inferiority.  Here's a test I give my graduate students, all talented and well educated.  Please analyze this Jackson Pollock painting and explain why it is good.  It is only after they give very eloquent answers that I inform them that the painting is actually a close up of my studio apron.  I don't blame them; I would probably have done the same since it's nearly impossible to differentiate between the two.

Our AI Generated Episode:


From drawing machines to early digital art and now AI, we’ve wondered whether the fundamentally human seeming endeavor of ART MAKING can be done by machines. At Idea Channel, we think the answer is unequivocally, yes! Perhaps the better question would be, will we ever let machines make art on their own? Will we ever be able to scrub away the influence and bias of the humans that created the machines making said art? And if so, how will we respond to the art being made by machines? How will it be appreciated? Will AI produced works ever be treated as art is traditionally treated–widely traded, curated, collected, critiqued? Let us know what you think in the comments below!

244,XwFFjO_6YK,30 DRAWING TRICKS YOU'LL WANT TO TRY RIGHT AWAY,"HOW TO DRAW 3D PICTURES

Have you ever wondered how to make your drawings pop and come to life? Learn how to draw 3D steps with ME!

1.Start by sketching a rectangle. Draw two vertical lines, making sure the spacing on the left side is slightly wider than the space on the right. Draw another vertical line about the same length as the first. Draw a diagonal line and a horizontal line like in the image.

2. Repeat this process to continue the staircase. Make sure all of the diagonal lines are parallel to one another.

3. Continue this process to the far right side of the rectangle.

4. Trace around the image with a darker pencil or pen, and erase all unwanted pencil marks. Fill the top area with black.

5. With a pencil, lightly sketch in a second set of steps on the left side. The illusion still works without these extra steps, but they will add extra effect. Trace around them with a darker pencil or pen.

6. Add some shading to the narrow rectangular shapes, like in the image. Fill in the bottom side with black.

7. Spin your paper approximately 45 degrees to the right. Sit back and see the illusion!

About TEDx, x = independently organized event
In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)",Arts and Music

They spoke at TEDxFargo about the benefits of letting go and living a meaningful life with less. For more info about The Minimalists visit

249,46WZ18yhHI,ART SUPPLIES THAT AREN'T WORTH THE MONEY | REVIEWING BAD ART SUPPLIES!?,"▼ OPEN ME FOR SUPPLY LIST & MORE ▼

In this video I talk about the supplies that I don't think are worth the money, either they're just plan bad art supplies, or they just cost way too much for the quality you get. Hopefully this helps you learn what not to buy, or helps you with any decisions you're trying to make!

So obviously certain prices have changed since I filmed this video! I also found some cheaper listings for some of the supplies - a notable one is the Sakura Koi Watercolor Field Sketch Set - I was actually able to find a listing that is CURRENTLY at $15.83, so that obviously brings the price down a lot! I also found the Factis Eraser on DIck Blick for $.99 & have listed that link instead. NO idea why I didn't think to check/cross reference prices there. Remember prices change especially online so obviously do your research and shop around before you purchase anything! Finally a wonderful commenter has let me know that the 9x12 pad of the Bee Watercolor Paper isn't the 100% cotton - I have not personally tried that one, so I can't attest to it. However, I have added a link to the 6x9 that I have that IS 100% cotton - that one I can 100% vouch for. It is roughly $13 for 50 6x9 watercolor sheets.

253,jnS66SszwE,The art of seduction | Seema Anand | TEDxEaling,"The ancient arts of Courtesanery and Seduction were once treated as high philosophy, with divine and academic associations. Dr. Seema Anand explores how these narratives have been lost and in the evolution of their vocabulary, the implications have changed. Working with the range of what 'story' can mean to an individual Seema facilitates the learning processes of 'telling', 'listening', 'acknowledging' and 'rejecting' the narratives that make up our lives and our social interactions to enhance communication, build links and open dialogue.

255,N0u04EqNVj,The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv,"On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. 


Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).

In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.

The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.

On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtv

Was the most expensive painting ever sold at auction a fake? This award-winning documentary explores the authenticity of the Sunflowers painting by Vincent van Gogh, bought in the late 1980s for a then record sum by a Japanese insurance company.

In 2002, the painting went on public exhibition alongside an undisputedly genuine version of Sunflowers, raising once again the questions so vividly posed in this film.

What do you call a hairpiece worn by a man? How southern was William Faulkner? Carrie Roy answers these questions and more though sculpture, woodwork, fiber arts, photography, and even virtual reality.

Carrie grew up on a cattle ranch in southeast North Dakota and received her BA from Harvard in Visual and Environmental Studies. Carrie forges art that bridges the capabilities of computers and the creative touch of humans. Her humanities research explores turning complex works of human expression into numbers.

274,zNrEFpkgWQ,"""Mastering the Art of Manifesting"" Wayne Dyer at Wanderlust's Speakeasy","The greatest gift you have been given is the gift of your imagination. Everything that now exists was once imagined. And everything that will ever exist must first be imagined. Wayne Dyer's ""Wishes Fulfilled: Mastering The Art of Manifesting""  at the Wanderlust Festival Speakeasy in Squaw Valley 2012 was an event that everybody who attended couldn't stop talking about: it offered a voyage of discovery, complete with tools to begin to tap into the amazing manifesting powers that you possess within you and create a life in which all that you imagine for yourself becomes a present fact.

""You must be able to get to this place in your life where you don't use the evidence of your senses. What your eyes tell you, what your ears tell you, what your stomach tells you. You want to be able to be in a place where you are living from the end as if what you would like to manifest is already there. To make a future dream a present fact you must assume the feeling of that wish as already being filled.""

Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explores the region of your highest self; and definitively shows you how you can truly change your concept of yourself. By practicing the specific technique for retraining your subconscious mind, Dr Dyer encourages you to not only place into your imagination what you would like to manifest for yourself, but you are invited to get into the specifics for realigning your life so you can live out your highest calling and stay connected to your Source of being. From the lofty perspective of your highest self, you will learn how to train your imagination in a new way. Your wishes, all of them, can indeed be fulfilled.

Wayne W. Dyer, PH.D., is an internationally renowned author and speaker in the field of self-development. He's the author of over 30 books, has created many audio programs and videos, and has appeared on thousands of television and radio shows. Many of his books have been New York Times bestsellers including ""10 Secrets for Success and Inner Peace"", ""Excuses Begone"",  and ""Wishes Fulfilled"". Dyer holds a Doctorate in Educational Counseling from Wayne State University and was an associate professor at St. John's University in New York. Today he is affectionately called the ""father of motivation"" by his fans. 

To learn more about Wayne, you can visit his website at  and check out his books available for purchase here: . Follow Wayne on Facebook here:  and twitter @DrWayneWDyer ().

Wanderlust Festival is also indebted to Hay House () who helped us realize the entire 2012 Speakeasy Lecture Series across all four festivals (Stratton, VT in June 2012; Copper Mountain, CO in July; Squaw Valley, CA in late July; and Whistler, BC, Canada in August). With Hay House's amazing roster of speakers (which you can witness in person at their incredible ""I Can Do It"" events), it's no wonder that they helped elevate the conversation at Wanderlust's Speakeasy this summer. We encourage you to stay tuned to the Hay House FB feed to make sure you know the next time one of their authors is speaking near you ().

His deep nostalgia for his own alma mater in Ohio -- the dining halls and dorm rooms, the parties and poetry seminars -- makes him wonder if his best days are behind him. So when his favorite professor (Richard Jenkins) invites him back to campus to speak at his retirement dinner, Jesse jumps at the chance. Meeting Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen) -- a precocious classical music-loving sophomore -- awakens in Jesse long-dormant feelings of possibility and connection.
