2,Tbrk0suwbg,"Artificial Intelligence & the Future - Rise of AI (Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sundar Pichai)|Simplilearn","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently the hottest buzzword in tech. Here is a video on the role of Artificial Intelligence and its scope in the future. We have put together the best clips on Artificial Intelligence by the most well-known leaders and influencers such as Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Warren Buffett, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai and Jeff Bezos. The last few years have seen a number of techniques that have previously been in the realm of science fiction slowly transform into reality. We have brought to you the business leaders of today speaking about artificial intelligence, what is fascinating about AI, the latest AI projects and what's in store for the future of AI. We will also answer the question of whether AI will someday overpower us humans. 

According to the report How AI Boosts Industry Profits and Innovations, AI is predicted to increase economic growth by an average of 1.7 percent across 16 industries by 2035. The report goes on to say that, by 2035, AI technologies could increase labor productivity by 40 percent or more, thereby doubling economic growth in 12 developed nations that continue to draw talented and experienced professionals to work in this domain. Let us see what our business leaders have to say about this.

Thore Graepel takes us inside the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and reveals its potential to solve some of the biggest problems facing the world today. He argues that there is nothing more human than the pursuit of artificial intelligence.


Thore Graepel is a research group lead at DeepMind and chair of machine learning at University College London. His research into artificial intelligence has helped to develop systems used by Xbox Live and Bing. Thore recently contributed to creating AlphaGo, the first computer program to defeat a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go.


__


At TEDxExeter 2019 our theme was The Art of the Possible. We‚Äôre living in an age of polarity where many communities are feeling more and more divided, against a backdrop of increasingly populist politics which risk dividing us even further. Our talks offer an opportunity to pause and consider the future we want to create, the possibilities that may be obscured in the busyness of our everyday lives, and how we might get there.
